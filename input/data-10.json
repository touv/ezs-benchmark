[{"id":0,"value":"Introduction Since the early days of seismology, the ubiquitous noise with periods 5 to 10 s has been clearly associated to ocean wave activity (for a historical account, see ). The corresponding ground motions have vertical excursions of the order of a few micrometers, hence their usual name microseisms. The detailed relationship between microseisms and ocean waves was only clarified much later with the observation by that the dominant frequency of microseisms is the double of the dominant ocean wave frequencies and follows its changes, suggesting that partial standing waves could be the origin of the recorded noise. The theoretical works of on the pressure induced by partially standing waves was the missing link that led to propose the first plausible theory of seismic noise generation as seismic Rayleigh waves generated by surface gravity waves in deep water. The theory was generalized to random waves by . The lack of a theoretical understanding did not prevent various propositions for using seismic noise as a source of information on ocean storms and weather, or for wave forecasting [ ; ], and a practical use of wave‐measuring devices based on seismometers eventually emerged [ ]. Yet, by the 1980s, ocean technology allowed routine wave measurements by buoys at sea, making the seismic ‘wavemeter’ almost obsolete. Further, satellite altimeters and synthetic aperture radars have provided routine and accurate measurements over the entire globe since 1991 [e.g., ; ]. The coarse space‐time and spectral coverage provided by satellites leaves an important potential use for seismometer‐based techniques in areas where in situ measurements are inexistent or not available [e.g., ]. The presence of low‐frequency energy in seismic records is a clear indication of long period waves associated with the most severe storms, as shown by and and can be used to investigate extreme wave events. Also numerical wave models need to be corrected for time‐dependent biases that are caused by the time‐dependent errors in the winds used as input [e.g., ]. Finally, seismic noise is related to the poorly known directional distribution of wave energy [e.g., ], and is also uniquely sensitive to very long period swells and their fore‐runners, with periods longer than 20 s, that are the fingerprints of the most severe storms [ ; ]. There is thus a need for understanding the seismic data for the analysis of ocean wave properties. Beyond the estimation of present sea states, the reconstruction of past time series of ocean wave parameters has emerged as a new possible application. Old seismographs go back to the early 20th century, which is 80 years before our modern age of space‐based measurements of ocean waves. , analyzed seismic noise variability at stations around the North Atlantic, from 1906 to 1980, to find evidence of a solar cycle in the the storm climate. He concluded that there is an 11‐year cycle in the seismic noise. Looking at his time series with our modern eyes, we rather see a correlation of noise levels with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Unfortunately details about the seismic data processing are missing to further verify that work. This quest for a quantitative link between wave climate and seismic noise has been taken up by others, with noteworthy efforts by for California, and for the North‐East Atlantic, while the analysis of many seismic records around the word indicate upward trends in seismic noise levels that was interpreted as an increase in ocean wave heights [ ]. Based on ocean wave buoy measurements, some skill was shown for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height ( H s ) over a few month period for Central California. the correlation was probably r ( H s ) > 0.8 for hourly time series, with Pearson's linear correlation for a quantity X defined by _placeholder_formula_ where the overbar denotes the arithmetic average, and X obs and X mod are the observed and modeled series. For the North Atlantic, a numerical wave model was used to find a significant correlation ( r = 0.71) for 6‐hourly time series between winter waves in various regions of the North‐East Atlantic, and noise levels at the Hamburg seismic station [ ]. Yet, with that correlation, seismic noise explains only half of the wave model variance ( r 2 = 0.5), and this was only applied to winters. It is thus premature to use results of these earlier studies to conclude on the general feasibility of wave estimation at other locations. Further, the retrieval of sea state parameters is not guaranteed beyond the seasonal time series that were studied. Thus, either for present‐day or historical wave reconstruction, there is a clear need for defining the conditions in which wave parameters can be estimated from seismic data, and to explore the systematic differences in sea states that may yield different seismic responses. The goal of the present paper is to extend these previous studies toward robust and generic methods for estimating sea state parameters from seismic noise. For this, we build upon the recent improvement in numerical wave models [ ; ], and the resulting good performance of a direct model of seismic noise. Seismic noise model results are well correlated with observed root mean square vertical ground displacements amplitudes. (hereinafter ASSM) obtained correlations higher than 0.85 for 4‐hourly seismic data over the entire year. also independently verified the location of the sources with the measured polarization directions of Rayleigh waves. This model may thus be used to guide the interpretation of seismic noise records, especially for estimating the locations of the noise sources and thus the locations where sea state parameters may be retrieved. However, this kind of model does not include three‐dimensional seismic propagation effect and may fail to explain the noise recorded at some seismic stations. In particular, it is important to recognize that several publications, most conspicuously the analysis of typhoon Ioke by , Figure S2] failed to find evidence of seismic noise propagation as surface (Rayleigh) waves from deep water to land. Along this line, many published analyses of seismic data interpret high noise levels from some direction that intersects the coastline as evidence for the importance of the coast in the generation of this noise [ ; ; ]. Others interpreted their measurements as evidence of this deep water to land propagation [ ; ; ; ]. From observations alone it is clearly impossible to decide on the position of one or several sources along a great circle in a given back‐azimuth. This is where a numerical model provides interesting additional quantitative information by estimating the plausible energy levels of the sources at each point in the ocean. Because of that controversy, we discuss below the quality of the model and the resulting uncertainties on the location of modeled noise sources. Our numerical model supports that there are plausible sources of Rayleigh waves generated in deep water that occasionally dominate the signal recorded at land‐based stations, including stations in California. These modeled deep sources occur systematically at the same time as the largest outliers in the correlation of wave heights and seismic noise levels. We shall thus use these modeled sources as a proxy for outliers in order to reduce our errors on wave height estimation. After a review of the underlying theory in , we will discuss, in , why and how seismic noise correlates with sea state parameters for seismic stations dominated by nearshore seismic noise sources, with or without wave reflection at the shoreline. In we explore the case of seismic stations that record noise generated in large areas. In both cases we propose a method for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height. Wave‐Noise Relations Expected From Theory General Considerations Ocean waves are known to generate microseisms via at least two distinct generation mechanisms. Primary microseisms, with a frequency equal to the ocean wave frequency, are only generated on sloping shallow topography in coastal areas [ ]. Here we only consider the secondary microseisms, which are far more energetic and generated over large regions of the ocean. They appear when ocean wave trains with nearly opposite directions and identical frequency f are superimposed [ ; ], which makes noise at the double frequency (DF) f s = 2 f. Following , we neglect changes in seismic group velocity U along their propagation path. We further assume that seismic waves are damped with a quality factor Q , such that, for a given seismic station, UQ is a constant for all the dominant seismic modes recorded by a given seismometer. The seismic noise power spectrum F δ recorded on the vertical component at a station of longitude λ and latitude ϕ on the Earth's surface is given by the directional wave spectra over the ocean at all positions ( λ ′, ϕ ′) through the source S DF ( f s ). With Δ the spherical distance between source and station, and R E the Earth radius, it is _placeholder_formula_ where d A = R E 2 cos ϕ ′ d λ ′d ϕ ′ is the elementary area of the ocean surface Ω. Finally P ( λ ′, ϕ ′, f s ) is an empirical correction factor for three‐dimensional propagation effects. When P = 1 as in , the propagation of the seismic (Rayleigh) waves correspond to a vertically symmetric earth model. Several measurements with pairs of nearby stations, one on land and the other at the bottom of the ocean, have shown that the noise recorded on land can be much weaker than that recorded at the ocean bottom [ ; ]. This suggests that for land stations P is generally less than unity, probably due to the refraction of seismic waves by the ocean‐continent gradient in phase speed as well as change in group speed and ratio of energy to surface ground variance [e.g., ]. The prominence of distant versus local sources is controlled by the geometrical spreading factor 1/sin Δ and, more importantly, by the magnitude of Q. For high Q s, seismic sources from large distances can be recorded, while low Q s reduce the typical distance from which sources can be recorded. For example, taking f s = 0.15 Hz, U = 1800 m/s and a low value of Q = 100, the seismic energy is reduced by a factor 2 every 130 km. This distance is proportional to Q , and thus a high value Q = 800 will yield a significant contribution from more remote sources ( ). The local source of seismic noise S DF ( f s ) is the contribution to the vertical ground displacement spectral density, per unit distance of propagation of the seismic waves [ ] (equations 1–5 in ). This source can be expressed from the frequency‐directional ocean wave spectrum F ( f , θ ) which is often expressed as a product of the frequency spectrum E ( f ) times an angular distribution function M ( f , θ ) _placeholder_formula_ where θ are the wave propagation directions. For ease of reading, the dependence of the seismic source on λ ′ and ϕ ′ is now implicit as we only consider the local wave and seismic response properties. The local conversion from ocean waves to seismic Rayleigh waves is a function of the ratio of sound wavelength and water depth, represented by a non‐dimensional coefficient _placeholder_formula_ , _placeholder_formula_ We obtained the mode coefficients c n , as defined by , by following the procedure outlined by , which involves solving for the coupling of ocean waves and seismic waves with a uniform ocean and semi‐infinite crust. Here the model was applied with N = 1, i.e. keeping only the first two modes. shows that for a given frequency, only a narrow range of depths gives a very strong response. For ocean waves of periods 8 to 16 s, noise generation is several times larger at depths in the range 1500 to 3000 m compared to water depths less than 500 m or more than 4000 m. Taking constant water and crust densities ρ w = 1000 kg m −3 and ρ s = 2500 kg m −3 , the source is _placeholder_formula_ where β = 3000 m s −1 is the crust shear wave velocity, also assumed constant. I ( f ) is a non‐dimensional function that depends only on M ( f , θ ), _placeholder_formula_ This directional integral means that there will be noise if and only if there is some energy in opposite directions θ and θ + π and at the same frequency f . Refinement of the Pelagic and Coastal Source Classification Into Three Classes Due to the necessary presence of waves in opposing directions, only specific sea states can yield significant levels of seismic noise. Until recently, two main types of sources had been considered, generally termed ‘pelagic’ and ‘coastal’ sources. Here we rather follow the terminology of . Taking that classification backwards, for a more simple description, class III corresponds to the events in which two wave systems of distinct origin but equal wave periods run into one another, these are most typically one swell from a remote source with a locally generated wind sea [e.g., , Figure 2], but can also be two swells from two remote sources. The two storms do not need to exist at the same time, but waves from one, when traveling at the group velocity, must cross the trajectory of waves from the other ( ). The other usual source occurs at or near any reflecting ocean boundary, usually the coasts, at mainlands or islands, we will call this class II. The noise generated in this case can actually come from deep water because part of the reflected wave energy propagates back across the open ocean. In practice, significant reflection can also occur in the marginal ice zone or around icebergs [ ; ]. Wave scattering over bottom topography may also produce opposing wave trains [ ], but it only occurs in shallow water, where the conversion of wave‐induced pressure to seismic noise is very weak. Conversely, wave refraction or scattering by current gradients may broaden the wavefield in deep water [ ; ; ], and contribute to seismic noise. Based on their numerical model, proposed that the most common source in the 0.1 to 0.3 Hz seismic frequency band, albeit weak, is generated by a single wind sea system. Indeed, because of the nonlinear evolution of random waves [e.g., ; ], the directional spectrum has a very broad directional distribution, especially at frequencies a few times higher or lower than the peak frequency, so that there is always some energy in opposite directions that generate seismic noise. designated these sources as class I. Namely, noise can be generated by a perfectly stationary and uniform wind, not necessarily in a cyclonic storm as originally proposed by . This property has received little attention so far, except for high frequency waves [ , ; ]. From high frequency radar observations the energy of opposing wave trains can be estimated for wavelengths of a few tens of meters and shorter, corresponding to wave frequencies higher than 0.25 Hz [ ]. For longer waves, closer to the peak frequency, recent detailed directional wave measurements suggest that the wave spectrum is indeed broad enough [ ] to generate a significant level of noise. From a wave modeling point of view, the clean separation of seismic sources, into those due to reflection and the others, is practically impossible and meaningless. Indeed, in the Longuet‐Higgins‐Hasselmann theory, the noise source is always determined from the directional ocean wave spectrum, whatever the reason for the existence of opposing wave trains. Yet, the relative amplitude of the two opposing wave trains should vary with the cause for their existence, and we show below that different causes can produce different relationships between seismic and ocean wave spectra. Noise Level and Directional Wave Spreading The overlap integral I ( f ) in can be estimated from pressure records at depths from 15 to 300 m [ ; ] but, unfortunately, it cannot be measured by conventional wave buoys. However, buoys provide a measure of the directional spreading σ 1 ( f ) which is a measure of the width of M ( f , θ ) [e.g., ], _placeholder_formula_ where the first directional moment is _placeholder_formula_ with θ 0 ( f ) the mean wave direction at frequency f . For a narrow spectrum, σ 1 ( f ) is the standard deviation (the half‐width) of the distribution M ( f , θ ). As illustrated by and discussed in , I ( f ) can vary by several orders of magnitude with changes in the directional distribution M ( f , θ ), even if E ( f ) remains the same. This variation forbids direct and generic relationships between the significant oceanic wave height _placeholder_formula_ and the seismic sources. Namely, a strong source can occur with a relatively low wave height, and a very large wave height may give a weak seismic source. In fact σ 1 and I may also vary differently for arbitrary shapes of M. Still, I ( f ) and σ 1 ( f ) can be related to E ( f ) for a majority of real spectral shapes. Class I Generation Here we consider noise generated by wind‐sea waves only, that are forced by the local wind, assumed uniform. Following the details in the, the seismic source in can be re‐written as and we may parameterize the directional integral I ( f ) from the wave power spectrum E ( f ), giving a relationship between E ( f ) and the seismic noise spectrum F δ (2 f ) in the form _placeholder_formula_ The frequency‐dependent coefficients a and b represent a proportionality coefficient, and an exponent that define a transfer function from the seismic spectrum to the wave spectrum. If the directional integral I ( f ) had been constant, we would have b = 0.5. However, as detailed in , we expect b > 0.5 because I ( f ) generally decreases when E ( f ) increases. Class II Generation When coastal reflections are the sources of the opposite wave trains, we may also simplify the noise model, as proposed by . Assuming that reflection is linear, a narrow incident wavefield from direction θ m produces a back‐scattered wavefield in the opposite direction θ m + π , with a spectral density of the reflected waves reduced by a factor R o 2 ( f , θ m ) compared to the incident waves (see for details). For a wavefield that varies on scales much larger than the seismic attenuation scale UQ /(2 πf s ), the recorded seismic spectrum is then given by _placeholder_formula_ The integral is a function of the wave frequency only, similar to , equation 5]. We thus attempt to invert in the form _placeholder_formula_ where a and b are empirical coefficients that we will determine, and τ is a time shift that accounts for the travel time of waves from the center of the seismic generation area to the shoreline and back. For a linear reflection one would find b = 0.5, as used by , but we expect b > 0.5 because reflection is not linear. Indeed, the wave reflection coefficient is defined from the wave amplitudes outside of the surf zone, whereas reflection mostly occurs within the surf zone, after the wave height has been reduced by breaking. As a result, the reflection coefficient decreases when the incident wave energy increases [ ; ]. Class III Generation: Interaction of Two Wave Systems In this case, noise is produced by one swell system and the wind‐sea, driven by the local wind, or two swells. The noise source is now proportional to E 1 ( f ) E 2 ( f ) I ( f ) where E 1 ( f ) and E 2 ( f ) are the spectral densities of the two interacting wave systems, and I ( f ) is the directional integral which depends on the exact mean directions and spreads of the two wave systems. These events can produce a much stronger noise than classes I or II for a given significant wave height. already noted that, on the Oregon coast, offshore winds could produce seismic noise levels that would otherwise have been caused by waves twice as large. For classes I and II the energy levels of the opposing wave trains are related, but this is generally not the case in class III events. We expect some trends of increasing noise with increasing wave heights, in particular in the special case when the swell was generated by the same moving storm, as discussed by . One could also imagine that a background swell of more or less constant properties will allow the noise generated to be proportional to the energy of the wind sea. These relationships, however, are expected to exhibit a lot of scatter because the amplitude of swells running against a wind sea (or another swell) with the same frequency can be anything from 1 cm to 10 m. Example of Noise From Local Sources: The Berkeley Record and Central California Waves We may now estimate the local wave spectrum, offshore of San Francisco, using data from Berkeley seismic station (BKS), as done by , and compare it to that measured by the U.S. National Data Buoy Center buoy number 46013. Indeed, the analysis of the BKS by suggests that the seismic noise is attenuated with a damping factor Q of the order of 90–300, with possible even higher values at the lowest frequencies. This implies a localization of most of the seismic sources within a 150 to 250 km wide strip that extends from 36° to 45° N, from the shelf break toward the open ocean (the 50% contour in and ). The shape of this dominant source region is largely controlled by the depth‐dependent amplification coefficient _placeholder_formula_ in , as shown in , with a maximum located between 2000 and 3000 m depth for f s = 0.14 Hz, which is the peak frequency of the annual average seismic spectrum at BKS. Likewise, the sharp increase of the source level when crossing the Mendocino fracture zone northbound, at 40° N, is related to the shallower depth of the ocean bottom in that area. The source area has a rather large extent, and probably 5 to 20% of the noise energy is generated north of Cape Mendocino. Such remote coastal sources have been identified by . These sources certainly contribute to the scatter in our estimation of local wave parameters because the sea state in that area is only weakly correlated to the sea state at the 46013 buoy. For example, using 3‐hourly data for the year 2008, the correlation of H s recorded at the buoy 46050 (located 30 km from shore at 44° N) with the record at 46013 is r = 0.47 for the full frequency band but r = 0.74 for wave frequencies below 0.75 Hz. Seismic Data Processing We processed seismic records into 4‐hour blocks by averaging spectra obtained over 512 s segments. The seismic data are shifted τ = 2 hours back in time, which corresponds to a propagation of 70 km for waves with a period of 12 s, consistent with the location of the source maximum in the noise model, within 100 km from shore. , found that this time shift actually maximizes the correlation of the energy levels in ocean wave and seismic noise. The resulting spectra are averaged to a seismic frequency resolution of 0.01 Hz for f s < 0.2 Hz and 0.02 Hz otherwise, so that one frequency band from the buoy corresponds to one frequency band from the seismometer, at the double frequency and with a double bandwidth. This processing effectively averages 144 spectra for each band, thus the spectrum is estimated with 288 degrees of freedom, and an expected accuracy of ± 16% (± 0.6 dB) at the 95% confidence level [e.g., ]. The buoy data are similarly averaged over 4 hours but it consists of a succession of 20 minute records for each hour, which gives only 48 degrees of freedom at a resolution of 0.005 Hz and an expected random error of ± 40% (± 1.5 dB). Buoy data are thus intrinsically more noisy than the seismic record. In order to filter out Earthquakes and seismometer glitches, we have adapted the procedure described in , now filtering each frequency band separately. Namely, a spectral density was discarded when it jumped by a factor 10 or more over 4 hours. Here we integrated spectral wave parameters over the frequency band 0.05 to 0.18 Hz. As a result, for any time record, any missing spectral density in the seismic frequency band 0.1 to 0.36 Hz resulted in the full record being discarded. Wave Reconstruction Methods Without Classification We now attempt to retrieve the ocean wave frequency spectrum E ( f ) from the seismic noise spectrum F δ ( f s ), for f s = 2 f. This inversion of , uses the empirical in which the constants a and b are fitted. We first examine the correlation of the ocean wave and seismic spectral densities that we are trying to associate. Looking at wave measurements from buoy 46013 on , E ( f ) appears well correlated with F δ ( f s ), for f between 0.07 and 0.23 Hz. Similar results are obtained with buoy 46214 (for locations, see ). The uncertainty of the spectral estimates, 1.4 dB for the wave spectra, is clearly less than the scatter in the seismic‐to‐wave relationships shown in . There are signs that different wave directions result in different seismic energy levels. At the higher frequencies in , a cloud of orange dots stand out with wave energies relatively higher than that of blue dots that have the same seismic spectral density. These orange dots correspond to waves with a mean direction between 320 and 340 that propagate almost alongshore and for which reflection is expected to be weaker, giving a weaker seismic noise. However, this trend is not very clear, and could also be contaminated by remote sources. We will thus ignore the possible dependence of a and b on θ m . There are, in general, a significant number of outliers with low wave energy. These are likely due to non‐local seismic sources that dominate the BKS record when the local waves are very small. We therefore exclude the lowest 10% values of E ( f ) and fit a linear relationship between the logarithms of the two spectral densities, as illustrated by the solid lines in . The fitted slopes give an exponent b that is systematically greater than 0.5, as expected from our analysis in . That larger b will increase the range of our estimates of wave energy. The equivalent significant wave height estimated from the seismic spectrum is given by _placeholder_formula_ When reconstructing the wave spectra and significant wave heights, as shown in , a constant exponent b = 0.5 tends to give a limited range of values, with minima overestimated in summer and maxima underestimated in general. A frequency‐dependent b appears better suited for the reconstruction of extreme events. For example, on January 8, the estimated significant wave height ( H s ) reaches 9.1 m, in close agreement with the observations. gives error statistics for the reconstruction using various methodological refinements described below. The better quality of reconstructions with a frequency‐dependent b is also demonstrated by the smaller errors on the mean periods, with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 10.4% instead of 12.4%. This smaller error shows that the spectral distribution of the energy is in better agreement with the observations. Variability of Empirical Parameters With Noise Generation Classes A striking feature of our analysis is the seasonal variation of the exponent b in , as shown in . We interpret this as a seasonal shift in the dominant class of noise generation, linked to seasonal patterns of winds and waves. This feature is robust because similar results are obtained when reconstructing data for the other buoy (number 46214), and the variation of b is stable for frequencies at which the correlation between spectral level time series is highest. analyzed that, in summer, dominant waves off this part of the coast are driven by along‐shore winds, with a typical direction from 320°. This along‐shore wind sea is hardly reflected by the shoreline and thus the directional integral I ( f ) is simply given by the directional spectrum of a single wind sea in an unbounded ocean. Logically, the noise model of predicts that class I generation dominates in summers. This is illustrated by , in which the thick green curve (modeled noise without reflection), follows very well the blue curve (observations) from May to mid‐October. The fact that the green curve is almost on top of the red curve (full model including reflection) means that, according to the model, coastal reflection has no significant effect on the seismic noise sources. In contrast, during winter months, the wind and wave orientations yield stronger reflection at the coast, which makes class II the dominant noise generation pattern. Besides this seasonal variation, a few other outstanding events with high noise level are apparently not related to shoreline reflection but are instead strong class III generation events, which leads to an overestimation of the wave height (blue stars in ). For example, the erroneously high waves estimated on January 26 (blue star in ) correspond to a complex marine weather situation, with heavy swells opposing strong local wind‐seas (Figure 14 in ). The seismic root mean square displacement δ reached 2 μ m, the second largest noise event in 2008, although wave heights at buoy 46013 did not exceed 4.8 m, much less than the seismic estimate of 7.2 m ( ) when using b ( f ) adjusted for the first 20 days of the year, or 10.1 m when b ( f ) is adjusted for the month of December. In this event, the noise model without reflection reproduces very well the observed seismic noise, which means that the effect of coastal reflection is negligible. The difference between class I and class II is less pronounced, but still the empirically fitted exponent b varies from 0.6 for class II to 0.9 for class I. Wave Reconstruction Based on Noise Classification We now use our classification for improving the estimation of sea state parameters. The highest correlation between observed and estimated wave heights ( r = 0.91 for 4‐hourly values) is obtained when we eliminate class III events before estimating the exponent b , and do not include these events in the reconstruction of wave heights. For daily‐mean values the correlation is as large as 0.93 with a normalized RMS error of 16.5%. For this, we have defined class III‐dominated records as cases for which the noise model without reflection predicts a r.m.s. seismic displacement δ noref larger than 0.5 μ m at BKS, using U = 1.8km/s Q = 90, P = 1 (see ). Similar results are obtained with Q = 300, P = 0.28 and the combination of the 0.16° and 0.5°‐resolution models. With this definition, 3.6% of the time series are dominated by class III generation. In practice there is often some class II and class I generation from some regions of the ocean at the same time as class III in other regions. Yet this simple criterion serves our purpose of removing the largest outliers in a systematic way. This procedures does not remove weaker remote signals that may actually be due to any class of noise generation, such as the Atlantic storms recorded in Southern California and discussed by and . It would certainly be interesting to investigate possible systematic deviations associated with the presence of strong remote class II sources, in particular along the Oregon coast. This analysis is left for future studies. Based on our previous seasonal analysis we have assumed that class I dominates in summer (June to September) and class II dominates for other months. We thus take the averages of a ( f ) and b ( f ) for these two seasons, and apply either the winter or summer set of coefficients in . The difference between class I and class II is significant: if the same coefficients are applied for the entire year the correlation is limited, for the 4‐hourly time series, to 0.89 with summer coefficients and 0.90 with winter coefficients ( ). After calibrating our empirical model on the year 2008, we have applied it on other years, as illustrated on for the year 1994. In practice the buoy spectra for the year 1994 have a coarser frequency resolution and more limited frequency range, and the 2008 empirical model was estimated on similarly coarsened 2008 data. The year 1994 is particular with a low level of long period swells, resulting in shorter mean periods, and much more frequent significant sources of noise that, according to the model, are not related to coastal reflection. Yet the empirical model for 2008 reproduces well the observed wave heights on average. The definition of class III ( δ noref > 0.5 μ m) still leaves too many outliers that are effectively removed by redefining class III as δ noref > 0.1 μ m, but then a large fraction of the time series is lost. This example suggests that the retrieval of extreme wave statistics from seismic noise will likely require other techniques, such as proposed by for Hurricanes, but it suggests that the average sea state can be well reproduced by our simple method. In summary, it is possible to reconstruct wave parameter time series with random errors that are comparable to those of uncalibrated numerical wave models forced by re‐analysis winds ( ). More interestingly, the wave parameters have more stable and smaller biases, compared to uncalibrated numerical wave models. Seismic Noise From Strong Remote Sources Sea state estimation is more complex when seismic stations record noise from a large part of an ocean basin. First of all, no single wave buoy is representative of the sea states that contribute to the recorded seismic noise, so that it is not simple to define wave observations for calibration. Secondly, the sources may be generated by a much wider range of sea states, including many class III events, so that empirical seismic‐ocean wave relationship can be less robust. Still, the recorded seismic level may be linked with some measure of the wave energy over the area of noise generation. We take two examples, one from the North Pacific and another from the North Atlantic. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Kipapa (KIP, Oahu, Hawaii) Based on the model, a disk with radius 1000 km around KIP is expected to contain only half the sources seen by the station. This model was verified using higher resolution grids, down to 500 m along the shoreline with a finite element mesh similar to the one used by . The model underestimates the seismic noise level for f s < 0.16 Hz, probably due to an underestimation of coastal reflections by a constant coefficient. In order to test the relationship between wave heights and seismic noise, we use satellite altimeter data. These data are very sparse is time, but in the 50% source region and for the year 2008, there is at least one pass every day by one of the three satellites, Jason‐1, Envisat, and Geosat‐Follow‐On. Starting from the source of seismic noise given by , we integrate over the dominant noise frequency band, _placeholder_formula_ This time‐dependent integrated noise source is then used to define constant weights _placeholder_formula_ where i is a time index, and N are the number of time steps. Here we sum over the entire year so that N = 2190. Using these time‐independent weights, we now obtain an estimate of the daily averaged wave height _placeholder_formula_ We find that 〈 H s 〉 is highly correlated with the daily mean recorded seismic displacement 〈 δ rms 〉 ( ). A good estimator of North Pacific wave heights is _placeholder_formula_ The large 1.4 m offset in is likely related to the high level of background swell energy that, by itself, has only a small contribution to the noise through the reflection at the shorelines. The otherwise linear relationship may be a bit surprising given that the analysis of noise events for KIP shows that many large noise events belong to class III with the interaction of two independent wave systems (e.g., Figure 11 of ). Although a higher sea state generally gives a higher seismic noise, this is only true if the directional properties of ocean waves do not vary too strongly. This variation of the directional properties is the likely cause of the scatter between recorded noise and average wave heights. Replacing the satellite‐derived wave heights by the results of the numerical wave model of , with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree in longitude and latitude and a time step of three hours, we find that the full space‐time coverage of the model produces only a marginally better correlation with the seismic noise ( ). From this we conclude that the uncertainty in the estimation of sea state parameters is real, and not an artifact of the limited sampling of the satellite data used for validation. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Eskdalemuir (ESK, Scotland) In the North Atlantic, there is also ample evidence for a correlation of sea states and seismic noise [ , ], but this has usually been investigated by correlating time series of one seismic station with wave data from a single point. Here we use an area‐averaged wave height based, again, on the expected spatial distribution of seismic sources from the model ( ), and we analyze the seismic record of the ESK station. Because we expect that the noise sources for ESK have a smaller spatial extension than for KIP, the altimeter sampling error becomes more important and we prefer to compare modeled wave heights with noise energy levels. The correlation between modeled wave heights and the seismic RMS displacement at ESK is r = 0.84, compared to 0.81 using altimeter data ( ). The daily mean wave height thus explain at least r 2 = 70% of the variance in seismic noise amplitude at ESK. However, recorded RMS ground displacements are more tightly correlated with modeled noise using the model with a seismic wave damping factor Q = 300, Rayleigh group velocity U = 1.8km/s, and propagation factor P = 0.842. For a smaller time step of 3 hours the correlation is already as high as 0.95 as shown on . This difference between 0.84 and 0.95 must be due to the variability in the directional wave distributions that change the values of I ( f ) so that the same wave energy can give very different seismic noise levels. At any given time, the noise comes from a limited area within all the possible source locations seen over the year. The possible interpretation of the noise as an area average is thus misleading. Understanding and possibly parameterizing the variability of I ( f ) will thus be needed to arrive at more accurate sea state estimations from seismic noise. This may be achieved by a seismic array analysis, as performed by , which provides a time‐varying spatial distribution of the field of noise sources. Summary and Perspectives Previous empirical estimation methods for deriving ocean wave parameters from seismic noise were based on a priori relationships between wave and seismic noise spectra. Using a numerical model for seismic noise we were able to show that the wave to noise transfer function is generally complex, due to the role of the directional distribution of wave energy. Our first conclusion is that it is paramount to have a basic knowledge of the spatial distribution of the noise sources that contribute to the record at a given seismic station. This is where the direct numerical noise model is most useful. Some stations, most notably in Hawaii, record noise that was probably generated in a large portion of an ocean basin, while others only record noise mostly generated over a nearby ocean area. The most common situation is intermediate, as we have found for many stations on mid‐oceanic islands. In the case where the seismic station record is dominated by local sources, it is relatively simple to correlate the seismic spectra with data from one representative point in the ocean, and two main situations emerge which can lead to simplified and invertible transfer functions for noise generation dominated by classes I and II. When the presence of opposite wave directions is due to coastal reflection, as considered by and , noise level at any frequency is well correlated with the wave spectral density at half that frequency, to an exponent b ≃ 0.7. The departure of this exponent from 0.5 is due to the general decrease of reflection coefficients when wave energy increases. In some particular settings when dominant winds blow alongshore, such as off Central California in summers, wave reflection has little to do with noise generation. Noise then apparently results from the broad directional distribution of the wind‐sea, which contains enough energy in opposing directions to explain the observed seismic noise. In this case, the noise spectrum is almost proportional ( b ≃ 0.9) to the wave spectrum at half the seismic frequency, which means that the directional integral I in the noise generation varies almost like the inverse of the wave energy. In the case of Central California, these two situations are typical of winters and summers, respectively, and a numerical noise model, or some information on wind direction can be used to make a fine discrimination between the two cases. Some kind of noise model will be most relevant for finding, in the noise record, the third class of noise generation, that provides intense noise level when two independent wave systems with opposing directions and same frequency coexist. These events can lead to strong overestimations of wave heights. Once they are removed, the correlation between measured daily mean wave heights and estimates from the seismic station can be as high as 0.93. These improvements in the wave reconstruction can be applied to investigate past wave climates more accurately. Yet, the investigation of extreme events should be considered with caution due to possible class III contamination. For seismic stations that appear to be representative of a large oceanic area, due to a weaker seismic attenuation or a wider spatial distribution of sources, data from a single seismic station can be related to an area‐averaged wave height. This is the case of North‐Western European stations and all the oceanic island stations that we have investigated (in Azores, Falkland Islands, Martinique, Reunion, Easter Island, French Polynesia). For these, the larger variability of wave directional properties across the source area results in a relatively larger scatter. Estimated wave heights are correlated with observed or modeled wave heights, but linear correlation coefficients are typically less than 0.88 for daily mean values. For all seismic stations, we expect that seismic‐derived wave heights averaged over time periods of one month or one year, or results of direct seismic modeling, as done by , can be useful datasets for correcting the slow drift of numerical wave models.

Titan is tidally locked with respect to Saturn and subject to periodic tidal forcing of its interior and surface, resulting in diurnal stresses at the satellite's surface. In addition, with one hundred Titan flybys to date, the Cassini‐Huygens mission exploring the Saturnian system since 2004 has revealed the remarkable geologic diversity of Titan's surface, exhibiting a number of features morphologically similar to what is found on our own planet [e.g., Jaumann et al. , ; Coustenis and Hirtzig , ; Solomonidou et al. , ], albeit composed of different materials (ice instead of rock, hydrocarbons in different phases instead of water). The geologic surface features are partly attributed to exchange processes between the satellite's interior, its surface, and its atmosphere [ Grasset et al. , ]. From the Cassini spacecraft, Titan's landscape has been observed by multiple flybys, examining the surface expressions through radar and infrared instrumentation. The images obtained using the Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument and the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) revealed that Titan hosts a complex surface characterized by mountains, drainage networks, dunes, faults, and possibly volcanic‐like features [ Jaumann et al. , ; Lopes et al. , , ; Solomonidou et al. , , and references therein], which resemble Earth‐like geologic structures and terrains [e.g., Coustenis and Hirtzig , ]. Only a few impact craters have been identified on Titan owing to intense resurfacing [ Wood et al. , ]. Furthermore, the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIMS) on board the Cassini spacecraft provides spectral imaging of Titan's surface at specific wavelengths in the 0.8 to 5.2 μm range. These are indicative of the diversity of the geologic terrain types, which are subject to complex erosional and depositional processes. The surface properties can be inferred from such observations using narrow methane spectral “ windows” located in the near‐infrared and centered at 0.93, 1.08, 1.27, 1.59, 2.03, 2.79, and 5.00 μm, where the methane absorption is weak enough to allow for probing of the surface [ McKay et al. , ; Griffith et al. , ]. When atmospheric scattering and absorption effects are properly accounted for, information on the nature of the surface can be extracted using radiative transfer codes [e.g., Hirtzig et al. , ]. The nonspherical part of Titan's static gravitational field is predominated by spin and tidal contributions. Using different flyby geometries of the Cassini spacecraft, Iess et al. [ ] determined the polar oblateness and equatorial ellipticity of the static gravity field independently from each other. Titan's ratio of the corresponding tidal and spin gravity coefficients C 2,2 and J 2 is close to the theoretical prediction of 3/10for a synchronously rotating satellite in hydrostatic equilibrium, from which Iess et al. [ ] infer an upper bound of 0.34 for Titan's axial moment‐of‐inertia (MoI) factor. If nonhydrostatic contributions are tentatively attributed to the degree‐3 terms, Titan's MoI factor may be as low as 0.33 [see Iess et al. , ] (supporting information), which is still inconsistent with fully differentiated interior models of Titan that would produce even smaller MoI factors [e.g., Grasset et al. , ; Sohl et al. , ; Tobie et al. , ]. Nimmo and Bills [ ] explain Titan's shape or long‐wavelength topography [ Zebker et al. , ] and the small magnitude of associated gravity anomalies [ Iess et al. , ] in terms of lateral thickness variations of a conductive floating outer ice shell with isostatically compensated ice topography and about 100 km thick on average. Titan's significant orbital eccentricity and obliquity cause periodic variations of the nonspherical part of the static gravitational field resulting in diurnal stresses at the satellite's surface. These diurnal tides could play a major role for Titan's geologic surface record. For example, the formation of cycloidal features and strike‐slip faults on synchronous satellites such as Europa is attributed to diurnal tidal stresses induced by nonzero orbital eccentricity, nonzero spin‐axis obliquity, and physical librations of their outer shell being mechanically decoupled from the deep interior [ Hurford et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ]. A measure for the tide‐induced internal redistribution of mass is the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 that is related to the radial density distribution and rheological structure of Titan. Radio science data from six close flybys of the Cassini spacecraft allowed Iess et al. [ ] to infer two solutions for k 2 of 0.589 ± 0.15 and 0.637 ± 0.224 (both with 2 σ errors), respectively, corresponding to tidal variations of about 4 % relative to the static degree‐2 terms, which is consistent with the existence of a global ocean at depth. Baland et al. [ ] and Bills and Nimmo [ ] invoke the presence of an outer ice shell, mechanically decoupled from the deep interior by a subsurface ocean, as plausible explanation for Titan's notable spin axis obliquity of about 0.3° relative to the orbit pole [ Stiles et al. , , ]. In the present study, we focus on the distribution of diurnal tidal stresses at the satellite's surface and possible links to geologic surface features on Titan. In , we describe the construction of structural models of Titan's interior based on Cassini gravity data and how the corresponding tidal stress pattern at Titan's surface is calculated. Results are presented in and put into perspective with morphotectonic surface features and related geologic processes in . Finally, discusses possible connections between the diurnal tidal stress pattern and volcanic‐like and tectonic‐like surface features on Titan with implications for the satellite's habitable potential. Model Description Structural models of Titan's interior are required to satisfy the global parameters that are listed in Table . In the absence of seismological observations, gravitational field and rotational data provide important information on the satellite's radial mass distribution and rheological structure. The gravitational field and rotational data collected by the Cassini mission suggest that Titan is in almost perfect hydrostatic equilibrium with its tidal and centrifugal potential. Furthermore, the orientation of Titan's spin pole is consistent with the assumption that the satellite's outer ice shell is partly decoupled from the deep interior by a subsurface ocean (see ). Iess et al. [ ] concluded that the Cassini gravitational field observations could be explained either by incomplete separation of the primordial ice‐rock mixture or the presence of a substantially hydrated silicate core. However, the former hypothesis has been challenged by parameterized thermal evolution models, suggesting that Titan's rock content were sufficiently high to facilitate substantial melting and complete separation of the primordial ice‐rock mixture [ O'Rourke and Stevenson , ], whereas the latter requires efficient removal of long‐lived radiogenic heat sources such as potassium from the core to delay the onset of silicate dehydration [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ; Fortes , ]. In the present study, we consider hydrated silicate cores because fully differentiated interior structure models are difficult to maintain considering Titan's inferred axial moment of inertia [ Iess et al. , ]. We note that compositional details regarding the long‐term stability of hydrated silicates, e.g., the accumulation of sodium and potassium leached early in Titan's history at the ice‐rock interface during ocean freezing [ Zolotov , ; Sohl et al. , ], are not central to the present study because we are mainly interested in the outer part of Titan's mechanical structure that determines the satellite's tidal response at the surface. We here assume that Titan is close to hydrostatic equilibrium and that the satellite's present interior structure can be characterized by four chemically homogeneous reservoirs, consisting of a hydrated silicate core (), a high‐pressure pure water‐ice mantle (), and a subsurface water‐ammonia ocean overlain by a conductive floating outer ice shell composed of low‐pressure water‐ice Ih and sI methane hydrate (). The set of differential equations for mass m , moment of inertia I , gravitational acceleration g , and hydrostatic pressure P can be derived from fundamental principles: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where r is the radial distance from Titan's center, G is the gravitational constant, ω is Titan's rotational angular frequency, and ρ is the local density, which will be explained in detail further below. Throughout the silicate core and the high‐pressure water‐ice shell, we calculate the thermal structure by solving the following two differential equations for heat flux q and temperature T in thermal steady state: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where k c is the thermal conductivity and N u r is the local Nusselt number. Here the subscript r explicitly indicates that the quantity is a local function of pressure, temperature, and composition. The specific heat production rate ε is adjusted to meet Titan's surface temperature T s of 94 K. The local Nusselt number parameterizes the strength of the convective heat flux and can be expressed as [ Wagner et al. , ] _placeholder_formula_ where k v is an effective thermal conductivity due to convection [ Kimura et al. , ; Wagner et al. , ] and ∇ T S =− g α T / C P is the adiabatic temperature gradient, with the thermal expansivity α and the specific heat capacity C P . The effective thermal conductivity k v is dependent on viscosity and obtained from the modified mixing length theory developed by Sasaki and Nakazawa [ ] to model low Reynolds number flow in solid planetary bodies. The viscosity of the silicate core is adjusted such that the central temperature will not exceed a critical threshold temperature of about 900 K for silicate dehydration [e.g., Perrillat et al. , ; Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ]. The mixing length approach allows to formulate a localized stability criterion for the onset of thermal convection, which is based on the comparison between the local temperature gradient and the adiabatic temperature gradient. If the local temperature gradient is superadiabatic, k v is greater than zero, buoyant material will rise due to the density contrast to the surrounding matter, resulting in a local Nusselt number (equation ) larger than unity. If the local temperature gradient is subadiabatic, k v is zero, the fluid material is stably stratified with respect to thermal convection, and the local Nusselt number equals one. Although this treatment slightly overestimates the heat flux at very low Rayleigh numbers [ Abe , ], the extended mixing length theory has been successfully applied in previous studies [e.g., Sasaki and Nakazawa , ; Abe , ; Senshu et al. , ; Kimura et al. , , ; Tachinami et al. , ; Wagner et al. , ]. For the sake of simplicity, the thermal structure of the outer ice shell and the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean is imposed by assuming a fixed thermal gradient from the given surface temperature T s of 94 K to the temperature of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean T o that is taken to be constant. The temperature gradient is given by the ratio between the temperature contrast and the thickness of the ice shell. With that simplified approach, we also ignore the possible existence of a thin convective sublayer at the base of the outer ice shell. Successful models are required to satisfy Titan's global parameters listed in Table . While the central conditions are m (0) = 0, I (0) = 0, g (0) = 0, P (0) = P c , q (0) = 0, and T (0)≤900 K, the surface conditions are m ( R s ) = m t , _placeholder_formula_ , _placeholder_formula_ , P ( R s ) = 1.467 bar, q ( R s ) = q s , and T ( R s ) = 94 K. Furthermore, the radius of the silicate core is derived from mass balance constraints, whereas the radial extent of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean sandwiched between low‐ and high‐pressure ice shells is calculated in accordance with the phase diagram of the H 2 O‐NH 3 system. Density and Elastic Moduli The differential equations described above are dependent on the local density ρ , which can be obtained from an equation of state. Apart from the outer ice shell, the density is calculated by using Murnaghan's integrated linear equation of state [ Murnaghan , ]: _placeholder_formula_ where ρ 0 and K 0 are the density and isothermal bulk modulus at the reference pressure ( P = P 0 =0 Pa), respectively, and K ′ is the first pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus K . The isothermal bulk modulus can be assessed by expanding K to the first order in pressure P : _placeholder_formula_ K ′ is explicitly dependent on temperature in the water‐ammonia ocean and is taken constant in the silicate core, high‐pressure ice layer, and outer ice shell. Furthermore, the rigidity μ , the adiabatic bulk modulus K , and the density ρ are related to the velocities of the compressional and shear wave v P and v S , respectively, _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where we assume that the adiabatic and isothermal bulk modulus are approximately equal, i.e., K S ∼ K T = K , under the relatively low temperature and pressure conditions prevalent in the interior of Titan. For the hydrated silicate core, we apply the Guinan‐Steinberg model to calculate the pressure dependent shear modulus at depth [ Guinan and Steinberg , ]: _placeholder_formula_ where μ 0 and μ ′ are the shear modulus and its pressure derivative at zero pressure, respectively, and x denotes the compression ratio ρ / ρ 0 . The temperature dependency of the shear modulus has been omitted owing to the relatively low temperatures that must be expected in Titans interior ( T (0)≤900 K). The Guinan‐Steinberg model is a well‐established approach to predict the shear modulus of materials at high pressures. We use the Guinan‐Steinberg model in the same way as we use an equation of state (EoS) and fit it to data obtained from high‐pressure experiments or first principles calculations to determine the reference parameters for equation as listed in Table 5. Hence, the obtained relationships are only valid to the limited pressure range (up to about 5 GPa) they have been fitted for and should not be used for extrapolation beyond the fitted range. The seismic velocities v P and v S are then obtained according to equations and . Gagnon et al. [ ] measured sound wave velocities in water‐ice VI via Brillouin spectroscopy. They found the following pressure‐dependent relationships: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where v P and v S are compressional and shear wave speed, respectively. We use both equations to calculate the seismic velocities within the high‐pressure water‐ice layer and obtain the depth‐dependent rigidity μ using equation . Since the shear modulus μ of a liquid vanishes, equation simplifies to the bulk sound velocity _placeholder_formula_ which we use to calculate the compressional wave velocity v P within the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean. The outermost ice shell is assumed to be composed of water‐ice Ih and sI methane hydrate. Using a linear planar fit, Helgerud et al. [ ] report equation of state and elastic parameters that are based on laboratory data: _placeholder_formula_ where F is the desired value (e.g., the local density ρ and elastic moduli K and μ ). Modeling details for each structural layer are presented in the , , and . Interfaces The interface between nearby chemical reservoirs is determined by the water‐ammonia phase diagram and Titan's global parameters as listed in Table . The thickness of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean sandwiched between low‐ and high‐pressure ice shells is calculated in accordance with the phase diagram of the H 2 O‐NH 3 system shown in Figure . As a consequence, the intersections of the calculated local geotherm and the melting conditions for a fixed ocean temperature determine the radial extent of the chemical reservoirs within Titan's water‐ice/liquid shell above the silicate core. For the low‐pressure water‐ice (Ih), the melting temperature T m as a function of pressure P m and ammonia content χ was derived by Leliwa‐Kopystyński et al. [ ] as follows: _placeholder_formula_ where T ref is a reference temperature of 273.1 K and a , b , c , d , and e are experimentally determined fit parameters. The corresponding fit parameters for the low‐pressure melting curve of a H 2 O‐NH 3 mixture are a = 7.95 × 10 −8 K Pa −1 , b = 9.6 × 10 −17 K Pa −2 , c = 53.8 K, d = 650 K, and e = 4×10 −8 K Pa −1 [ Leliwa‐Kopystyński et al. , ]. When considering the high‐pressure phases of water‐ice (III, V, and VI), a similar parameterization relating the melting temperature T m to pressure P m and ammonia content χ is given by [ Choukroun and Grasset , , ] _placeholder_formula_ where T ref and P ref are reference values, respectively, and a , b , c , and d are fit parameters. The latter term of equation has been obtained from Figure in Choukroun and Grasset [ ]. It roughly quantifies the reduction in melting temperature of the high‐pressure water‐ice polymorphs when ammonia is added into the water liquid. We list the corresponding values with respect to the appropriate water‐ice phases in Table . The interface between the water‐ice‐dominated mantle and the silicate core is then completely constrained by the global properties of Titan described in the previous section. In other words, the radius of the core is determined from mass balance constraints and Titan's physical properties as listed in Table . Diurnal Tides and Tidal Stresses Titan is subject to time‐varying radial and librational tides exerted by Saturn on the timescale of its orbital period. Disregarding small contributions due to obliquity tides, the main tidal potential is given by [ Segatz et al. , ; Moore and Schubert , ; Wahr et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ; Hussmann et al. , ; Beuthe , ] _placeholder_formula_ where r is the radial distance from the center of Titan and ω and e are Titan's mean motion and orbital eccentricity, respectively. _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ are associated Legendre polynomials of second degree. θ and φ are colatitude and longitude with zero longitude at the sub‐Saturnian point, and t is time. Owing to the external gravitational perturbation by Saturn the equipotential surface at Titan is radially shifted by Φ e / g s with g s the surface gravity. In general, the satellite's tidal response depends on its interior structure, thermal state, tidally effective rheology, and the frequency of tidal forcing, and is parameterized in terms of the degree‐2 body tide Love numbers h 2 , k 2 , and l 2 . We assume that the satellite's outer ice shell responds elastically to the tidal forces exerted by Saturn. This assumption is justified since diurnal tidal stresses are stored mostly elastically in the cold, stagnant outermost part of the ice shell and is widely insensitive to the specific rheology and thickness of the ice shell [ Wahr et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ]. We solve for the radial displacement Love number h 2 , the potential Love number k 2 , and the Shida number l 2 by numerical integration of the linearized field equations for small elastic deformations in a spherical, incompressible, and self‐gravitating body, accounting for certain continuity and boundary conditions [see Segatz et al. , ; Hussmann et al. , , and references therein]. As model inputs we use the calculated radial profiles of density and elastic moduli as described in .The ocean is modeled as an inviscid fluid layer by assuming a low rigidity and low viscosity while making sure that the tidal response is short as compared to the corresponding Maxwell time defined by the ratio of steady state viscosity and rigidity. For detailed descriptions of more general cases such as radially stratified, viscoelastic, and self‐gravitating spherical body and the solution of the equivalent elastic problem in the frequency domain, we refer the reader to Cheng and Toksöz [ ], Wahr et al. [ ], Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen [ ], and Beuthe [ ]. Since we are interested in global amplitude patterns of diurnal tidal stresses, we calculate the maximum tensile (areal) stress [ Zürn and Wilhelm , ] _placeholder_formula_ and maximum shear stress _placeholder_formula_ at Titan's surface, whereas the mean tidal stress _placeholder_formula_ is given by _placeholder_formula_ The diurnal tidal stresses σ θ θ , σ φ φ , and τ θ φ = τ φ θ are specified by the nonzero components of the stress tensor in latitudinal ( σ θ θ ), longitudinal ( σ φ φ ), and cross directions ( τ θ φ = τ φ θ ) and related to the time‐variable tidal potential Φ e at the satellite's surface (see ). Interior Structure and Tidal Stresses We have constructed 60 models of Titan's present interior structure. Shown in Figure are color‐coded thicknesses of Titan's icy crust, d c , and its subsurface water‐ammonia ocean underneath, d o , as a function of the satellite's degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 and mean moment‐of‐inertia factor MoI, respectively. In general, structural information, i.e., MoI, k 2 , and radial extent of outer ice shell (Figure a) and subsurface ocean (Figure b), is conveyed by the figure axes and color scale, whereas additional information about the bulk chemistry, i.e., NH 3 content and average core density, is encoded through symbol shape and size. In Figure a, it can be distinguished between thin (bluish), intermediate (greenish), and thick (reddish) outer ice shells. They correspond, respectively, to deep (reddish), intermediate (turquoise), and shallow (bluish) subsurface water‐ammonia oceans shown in Figure b. Furthermore, form and size of each symbol represent specific ammonia (NH 3 ) contents within the subsurface ocean and average densities of the silicate core, respectively. From top to bottom, the pyramid, square, diamond, and triangle marks denote an increase in NH 3 concentration varying among 0, 5, 15, and 25 wt %. From left to right, core density decreases with increasing symbol size. Filled symbols represent models with a water‐ice crust, while open symbols correspond to cases with a crust composed of water‐ice and methane clathrate in equal amounts by mass. The latter are shifted slightly to larger values of k 2 and MoI with respect to the former, thereby indicating that methane‐clathrate crusts tend to be denser and less rigid than pure water‐ice crust layers. This becomes even more pronounced with increasing thickness of Titan's outer ice shell. It is seen that k 2 is strongly related to both the crustal thickness d c and the subsurface ocean thickness d o , respectively. With increasing ocean density, e.g., in the presence of salty constituents and/or suspended sediment loads, valid models will be shifted to even larger k 2 values, thereby allowing for thicker outer ice shells. In terms of interior structure, we obtain similar results if the ammonia‐water ocean is replaced by a saltwater ocean with an NaCl content of 5 wt % (ocean density 1.15 g cm −3 ), similar to terrestrial oceans. Since extensive leaching of Titan's hydrated silicate core cannot be excluded, we show in Figure an example for a dense ocean composed of ammonium sulfate ((NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ) (density 1.35 g cm −3 ) based on a model proposed by Fortes et al. [ ]. Solutes leached from the hydrated silicate core (e.g., Cl − , HCO _placeholder_formula_ , SO _placeholder_formula_ , Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) could increase the density of Titan's subsurface water ocean. However, a number of hydrated salts would precipitate again upon ocean freezing and sink to the ocean floor. It must be also taken into account that the concentration of solutes in subsurface water oceans is probably significantly less than 10 wt % [e.g., Tobie et al. , ] with only little effect on the density of the liquid. As a consequence, melting point reduction by ammonia‐water solutions is a valid explanation to facilitate the possible existence of liquid water subsurface reservoirs on icy bodies in the outer solar system [e.g., Sohl et al. , ]. In general, models yielding thinner crusts and substantial subsurface oceans are found to correspond to larger body tide Love numbers k 2 and vice versa. Largely extended icy crusts can be ruled out, however, since models with ice shell thicknesses of more than 110 km are difficult to reconcile with the observational constraints imposed by the Cassini gravitational field data (black boxes) [ Iess et al. , , ]. In turn, valid models of Titan produce subsurface oceans that are at least 180 km thick. This is illustrated in Figure , in which we explicitly show how the calculated body tide Love numbers k 2 depend on the thicknesses of both outer ice shell and subsurface water‐ammonia ocean. It is even possible to construct valid models with subsurface oceans of about 430 km thickness, corresponding to structural models with vanishing high‐pressure water‐ice layers between the silicate core and the liquid ocean itself. In other words, in these cases the subsurface ocean were in direct contact with the silicate core with important implications for Titan's habitable potential [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ; Fortes , ]. Furthermore, inspection of the symbols and their sizes in Figure reveals that Titan's MoI factor is partly controlled by the density of the silicate core, shifting to larger MoI values with decreasing core density. For example, the satellite's moment of inertia will increase if less dense material is added to the core because of the smaller density contrast between the surface and the deep interior. In the presence of a subsurface ocean, the density distribution within the silicate core has a negligible effect on the body tide Love number k 2 , owing to the mechanical decoupling of the outer ice shell from the deep interior. Moreover, the ammonia (NH 3 ) concentration within the subsurface ocean provides bounds on the ocean temperature that are compliant with successful models of Titan's interior. The NH 3 concentration in the ocean (represented by the form of a symbol) likewise affects the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 . It is seen from inspection of Figures a and b that for lower NH 3 concentrations the symbols shift to larger values of each MoI and k 2 . For models corresponding to rather deep oceans with thicknesses of at least 370 km and relatively thin outer ice shells a few tens of kilometers thick, no firm constraints on the ocean composition (in terms of NH 3 content) can be imposed with respect to the reported 2 σ error margins of MoI and k 2 , respectively. Depending on the actual NH 3 content, ocean temperatures down to 220 K are possible for NH 3 concentrations up to 25 wt %. However, models with intermediate‐sized oceans of about 200 km depth and significant ice shells with thicknesses of about 100 km satisfy these observational constraints only if low NH 3 concentrations in the range of 0 to 5 wt % are present, corresponding to relatively warm oceans with temperatures in excess of 255 K. We consider the reference model illustrated in Figure as a plausible fiducial model of Titan's present interior structure that satisfies the 2 σ observational data of the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 based on Cassini gravity data. The model parameters are summarized in Table . The construction of the reference temperature profile requires three fixpoints, namely, the ocean temperature (prescribed), the surface temperature (94 K), and the central temperature (900 K). We then vary two core parameters—the effective specific heat production and the average viscosity—such that (i) the central temperature in the core stays below the critical temperature of silicate dehydration and (ii) the mean surface temperature of Titan is met. The calculated values of the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 are 0.34 and 0.44, respectively, commensurate with the low end of the reported 2 σ error margins of the latter [ Iess et al. , ]. The silicate core is about 2080 km in radius with an average density of 2.55 g cm −3 . This is in good agreement with the core radius range of 1980 to 2120 km and the corresponding density range of 2.57 to 2.46 g cm −3 obtained by Fortes [ ] for a broad suite of compositional models of Titan's interior. The specific heat production rate of the core is about half of that what would be expected for a chondritic bulk composition, consistent with the early leaching of radioactive isotopes [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ]. While the central pressure is 4.9 GPa, the pressure at the core‐mantle boundary is about 0.8 GPa. A significant high‐pressure water‐ice layer about 200 km in thickness with an average density of 1.3 g cm −3 is retained. For the subsurface water‐ammonia (H 2 O‐NH 3 ) ocean we obtain a thickness of about 180 km. The average ocean density is 1.1 g cm −3 . The ocean temperature is 255 K at an NH 3 content of 5 wt %. The outer ice shell is 110 km thick with an average density of 0.95 g cm −3 , in agreement with compensated floating ice shell models preferred by Nimmo and Bills [ ]. The temperature gradient across the shell is 1.4 K km −1 , rendering a surface heat flow of about 3 mW m −2 . Figure shows the global amplitude pattern of tide‐induced diurnal stresses at the surface of Titan for the reference model. It is distinguished between (i) maximum tensile stresses, σ areal , predominating in the equatorial and midlatitude regions of the sub‐ and anti‐Saturnian hemispheres (Figure a) and (ii) maximum shear stresses, τ shear , concentrated in the polar regions (Figure b). In other words, tidal stresses are more conducive to strike‐slip motion around the poles and to compression or extension at lower latitudes. The maximum diurnal tidal stresses, _placeholder_formula_ , shown in Figure c are calculated from the second invariant of the stress tensor and can be interpreted as superposition of the amplitude patterns of both tensile and shear stresses and, therefore, may serve as a measure for tide‐induced weakening of the crust layer, facilitating comparison with geologic surface feature. This suggests that tidal flexure and stress concentration are significantly enhanced in four adjacent, midlatitude zones, approximately situated between the directions of the apex and antiapex of Titan's orbital motion and that to the satellite's sub‐ and anti‐Saturnian points, respectively. Surface Geology, Morphotectonics, and Cryovolcanic Features Titan's surface hosts a large number of diverse features formed by fluvial, aeolian, impact, and possibly internal processes. From the detailed—albeit incomplete—account of the landforms seen by the Cassini‐Huygens mission so far, morphological similarities are apparent between geologic surface features observed on Earth and on Titan [ Solomonidou et al. , ]. For example, the presence of extensive dune fields [e.g., Radebaugh et al. , ] is indicative of aeolian processes predominating close to the surface, while drainage networks and lakes [ Stofan et al. , ] are likely related to precipitation and fluvial phenomena or subsurface reservoirs as part of Titan's alkanological cycle [e.g., Atreya et al. , ; Lebreton et al. , ]. Table lists reported observations of features on Titan's surface that could be related to endogenic activity. The morphologies, shapes, and locations of these surface expressions are informative about the underlying formation processes at work within the corresponding geologic terrains. It has been suggested that Titan's rigid icy crust could be assembled in the form of ice rafts reminiscent to terrestrial tectonic plates [e.g., Mitri et al. , ]. In the same vein, terrestrial phenomena like volcanism and/or the formation of linear features and drainage networks controlled by tectonics could also exist on Titan [e.g., Burr et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ]. The tectonic‐like origin of surface expressions like mountains, faults, and volcanic structures are suggestively related to ice rafts of altered densities moving on a liquid layer, thereby producing convergent or divergent surface features due to stresses caused by endogenic activity. In any event, it cannot be excluded that endogenic dynamics has played an important role for Titan's geologic activity. Additional types of surface features that are particularly interesting due to their uncertain formation history are those that seem to be surface expressions of Titan's possible internal activity, i.e., geologic structures resulting from upwelling or fracturing of the upper crust caused by endogenic dynamics. Representative features of this type are morphotectonic features [ Solomonidou et al. , ] and candidate cryovolcanic sites (Figure ). Cryovolcanism has been hypothesized on Titan as a means of replenishing methane in Titan's atmosphere [e.g., Tobie et al. , ], and it can also explain changes reported in surface brightness or morphologically volcanic‐like features [e.g., Lopes et al. , ; Soderblom et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Solomonidou et al. , ]. Other possibilities to explain these surface expressions prefer exogenic formation processes such as fluvial or lacustrine [ Barnes et al. , ; Moore and Howard , ; Moore and Pappalardo , ]. In any event, some areas on Titan's surface are likely to have exhibited brightness changes over time (cryovolcanic candidates) and/or have morphologies closely related to Earth's tectonic manifestations (e.g., mountains, faults). They are mostly located at equatorial latitudes between 30°S and 30°N and are likely associated with the surface stress field [ Soderblom et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Solomonidou et al. , ]. The mountainous regions were found to have elevations from 200 to 2000 m [ Radebaugh et al. , ; Mitri et al. , ; Lorenz et al. , ] and are characterized as mountain chains, hills, and ridges depending on their size, shape, and extension (see Table and Figure (left)). On Earth such features are mainly attributed to lateral motions of lithospheric plates, a geologic phenomenon that is largely unlikely to occur on Titan in the same fashion as it does on Earth. In spite of being a consequence of crustal movements, some blocks of mountains may have originated from impact ejecta [ Radebaugh et al. , ]. Other interesting areas on Titan are the so‐called “active” regions with reported changes in brightness and/or color over time [ Nelson et al. , ; Wall et al. , ]. In Table the characteristics of these cryovolcanic candidate sites are listed, among which are Tui Regio (20°S, 130°W), a 1500 km long flow‐like figure [ Barnes et al. , ], Hotei Regio (26°S, 78°W), a 700 km wide volcanic‐like terrain [ Soderblom et al. , ], and Sotra Patera region (15°S, 40°W) (formerly known as Sotra Facula), and currently including Mohini Fluctus, Doom Mons, and the Sotra Patera pit [ Lopes et al. , , ]. These areas together with others (see Table ) have anomalous spectral and morphological properties that are possibly caused by dynamic geologic processes [ Jaumann et al. , ; Lopes et al. , , ]. Among others, deep craters (Sotra Patera), lobate flows (Mohini Fluctus), and caldera‐like formations (in Hotei Regio) have been observed by Cassini RADAR and VIMS. In addition, VIMS data processing provided indications for brightness or surface albedo variations within a period of one to 3.5years. In analogy with terrestrial morphotectonic structures, the shape, size, and morphology of Titan's observed mountains, ridges, hills, and linear features such as faults, major fractures, and canyons probably originate through some form of compressional and extensional tectonic activity. Titan's rigid outer ice shell and the probable existence of a subsurface ocean create an analogy with terrestrial, at least surficial, plate tectonics. In this work, we have focused on the possible relations between solid body tides on Titan and observed geologic features on Titan's surface. Shown in Figure is a map including both the diurnal tidal stress and geologic information. On this map we see the morphotectonic features of Titan which are the current identified major types of tectonic‐like features (see Table ) and their distribution on the surface. These are the elevated features such as mountains (green), faults and fractures (blue), and the candidate cryovolcanic features (red). On this map is also overplotted the global amplitude pattern of maximum diurnal tidal stresses, _placeholder_formula_ , as shown in Figure c. This map reveals the correlation between features that are possibly tectonic and/or volcanic in origin and zones of intense tide‐induced surface deformation concentrated at midlatitudes. Four midlatitudes (50°S to 50°N) centered at (a) 40°, (b) 120°, (c) 230°, and (d) 310°west longitude, respectively, are the most amplified ones in terms of tidal flexure and stress accumulation, indicating zones of potentially high internal influence (Figure ). As seen in the overplotted maps, we find that most of the sites listed in Table are located within ±30°latitude from the equator in the leading hemisphere and therefore preferentially located within the strongly tidally flexed zones. This is particularly true for the mountains and the cryovolcanic candidates, while exceptions mainly concern the faults (blue dots on the map of Figure ) and a couple of highlands in the high northern latitudes around 60°N. We note that the volcanic‐like sites are concentrated in strongly tidally flexed zones as follows: Sotra Patera is located in the center of the (a) zone, confirming suggestions that rank this area as the most favorable candidate cryovolcanic region [ Lopes et al. , ]; Tui Regio is located within the limits of the (b) zone; and Hotei Regio is located on the border between these two zones of amplified tidal distortion. Discussion and Conclusions We have studied present‐day structural models of Titan's interior that are consistent with Cassini gravitational field data and simultaneously satisfy the satellite's inferred axial moment‐of‐inertia factor and degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 at the low end of the reported error margins of the latter [ Iess et al. , ]. In order to explain larger k 2 values than the average of the measured k 2 , one may invoke ad hoc density hypotheses such as (i) relatively dense liquids [e.g., Mitri et al. , ] or (ii) mushy lower ice layers, but their possible existence is not supported by observations at this point. The first class of models has the difficulty that oceans composed of almost saturated salty solutions or suspensions were required, resulting in the precipitation of dense or suspended constituents over time. On the other hand, the existence of a mushy ice layer on Titan would result in a phase shift between primary and secondary tidal potential that to our knowledge is not supported by Cassini gravity field observations. More accurate time‐variable gravity field data are required to resolve this issue. Amplitude patterns of both diurnal tidal tensile and shear stresses and their superposition were calculated and are compared to the spatial distribution of tentative volcanic‐like and tectonic‐like surface features on Titan. Though alternative explanations prefer an exogenic origin [e.g., Moore and Pappalardo , ], the correlation between the tidal stress patterns illustrated in Figure and the surface features seen on Titan may rather suggest an endogenic origin of the latter. The calculated diurnal tidal stresses are on the order of a few tens of kPa, comparable to the magnitude of maximum possible nonhydrostatic deviatoric stresses on Titan [ Gao and Stevenson , ], but the accumulation of tectonic stresses could eventually help exceed the tensile strength of fractured ice [ Kimura et al. , ; Smith‐Konter and Pappalardo , ]. True polar wander of the spin axis due to large‐scale redistribution of mass on the surface or within the interior and nonsynchronous rotation of the decoupled shell moving slowly across the satellite's permanent tidal bulge may cause the buildup of long‐term stresses and the formation of geologic surface features on a global scale [e.g., Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , , and references therein]. Furthermore, in the event of stress hysteresis owing to transient creep phenomena [e.g., Shoji et al. , ], the incomplete relaxation of tidal stresses could play a role for stress buildup over several tidal cycles. Similar to the tide‐induced seismicity of the Moon, episodic stress release accompanied by localized tectonic quakes may occur where a certain threshold stress limit value is exceeded. Recent laboratory experiments in the low‐temperature range below 220 K indicate that the resistence of polycrystaline water ice to tensile failure is strongly dependent on temperature, composition, grain size, and porosity [ Litwin et al. , ]. For consolidated pure ice and ice contaminated by solid impurities, tensile strength is reported to increase by a factor of a few times the commonly used value of 1 MPa, which could impede tide‐induced tectonism under Titan surface conditions. However, crustal porosity and the presence of near‐surface liquids would considerably reduce the ice resistence to fracture. Furthermore, these authors suggest that fracture toughness is more important than tensile strength in the event of low strain rates where fracture propagation rather than fracture initiation is the strength‐limiting factor. It is therefore conceivable that a porous ice crust soaked with liquids and subject to tide‐induced surface deformation would be conducive to the formation of zones of weakness near strongly tidally flexed areas as shown in Figure . The possible existence of crustal zones of weakness on Titan may cause episodic cryovolcanic activity induced by positive buoyancy through exsolution of volatiles upon decompression, and the subsequent ascent along fluid‐filled fractures in analogy to dikes [ Lopes et al. , ]. Another mechanism to promote localized cryovolcanism might be shear heating by tide‐induced strike‐slip fault motion as suggested by Nimmo et al. [ ] to explain the heat and vapor production within the tiger‐stripe regions near the south pole of Enceladus. Equally to the leading hemisphere, two near‐equatorial zones of strong tidal flexure and stress concentration are present on the trailing hemisphere. The apparent absence of cryovolcanic candidate features on the trailing hemisphere could be caused by the current observational bias toward the leading hemisphere. This is indicated in a recent multispectral map of Cassini VIMS and RADAR/SARtopo and altimetry data [ Lorenz et al. , ] that is based on extrapolation from the still relatively scarce data basis with several large gaps to be filled by future Cassini observations. Alternatively, the apparent hemispheric asymmetry of tectonic‐like and volcanic‐like features could be linked to erosional and depositional processes since Titan's surface is subject to intense resurfacing. The global distribution and characteristics of fluvial erosion on Titan indeed indicates seasonal climatic asymmetries between both hemispheres [ Langhans et al. , ]. Our findings further reveal that future Cassini observations of Titan's surface should focus on the tidally flexed regions in the trailing hemisphere and the polar areas that are more conducive to strike‐slip motions. It must be expected that these regions could bear additional marks of the satellite's endogenic activity. Titan is a dynamic satellite at present, as evidenced by the recent albedo changes observed in the Sotra Patera region and Tui Regio and the extensive surface changes spanning more than 500,000km 2 in the wake of a seasonal storm [ Turtle et al. , ]. Dynamic activity is thought to be conducive to habitable conditions on a planetary body as it allows the recycling of minerals and potential nutrients and provides localized energy sources by warm upwelling material. In a habitable environment, not only polymeric chemistry but also a fluid and semistable environment have to be present, as well as an energy source [ Schulze‐Makuch and Irwin , ]. Here we show that tidal forces are a constant and significant source of internal deformation on Titan. Furthermore, our model calculations suggest comparatively low ocean ammonia contents of less than 5 wt % and ocean temperatures in excess of 255 K, i.e., higher than previously thought, thereby substantially increasing Titan's potential for habitable locations. When addressing Titan's habitability, understanding its interior structure is of critical importance. In this study, we have adopted new laboratory data for the parameterization of the water‐ammonia (H 2 O‐NH 3 ) phase diagram [ Choukroun and Grasset , , ] to determine the sizes of Titan's bulk reservoirs (crust, ocean, and deep interior) by assuming an isothermal subsurface ocean. It is important to remember that the thicknesses of the outer ice shell and of the subsurface ocean are linked to each other through the pressure‐temperature phase relationships (phase diagram) of the water‐ammonia system. Therefore, higher ocean temperatures yield larger ocean thicknesses and thinner ice shells and vice versa. For reasonable amounts of NH 3 (< 25 wt %), the ocean temperatures of successful structural models of Titan's interior are dependent on the ammonia concentration in the ocean. Smaller ammonia concentrations lead to warmer subsurface oceans and vice versa. A thinner crust would clearly be more conducive to putative life, because it could result in frequent cryovolcanism and upwelling of ammonia‐water pulses near or onto the surface. Evidence for cryovolcanism was observed previously [ Sotin et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Wall et al. , ]. The diurnal tidal stresses as modeled for Titan could be large enough to result in geologic surface features: Liquid water‐ammonia outbursts on the surface of Titan would clearly be a sign of a dynamic planetary body and may also provide suitable environmental niches for life, at least on a temporary basis. As a first step, our results indicate that one should look for such manifestations at the surface to bring additional evidence for the presence of the liquid water ocean. Our modeling results also provide some constraints on the thickness of the water‐ammonia ocean. For our reference model, we obtain a large ocean of about 180 km thickness, which would provide a huge reservoir of liquid water and ammonia. However, the ocean would be sandwiched between two layers of ice (Figure a), and needed inorganic ions, which play a central role in Earth biology including redox chemistry (Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, Mo, Se, S), acid‐base catalysis (Zn, Ni), transmission and storage of energy and information (S, B, Si), and cell structure and homeostasis (Ca, Na, K), may be hard to come by [e.g., Fortes , ]. If the ammonia‐water solvent were in direct contact with the rocky core, as some models shown in Figure suggest, hydrothermal vent communities as observed on Earth and modeled for Europa [e.g., Irwin and Schulze‐Makuch , ] may represent a feasible possibility for Titan's subsurface. Our findings for a large, warm subsurface ocean with possibly a thin crust above enhance the habitability and astrobiological potential of Titan, but even more make it a special target for future exploration as an object with unique properties in our solar system.

Measurements of solar backscattered radiation at ultraviolet and visible (UV‐Vis) wavelengths from instruments such as Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), GOME‐2, Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been applied to retrieve many important atmospheric constituents including O 3 , NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , BrO, clouds, and aerosols [ ]. These UV‐Vis satellite observations provide valuable insight into the tropospheric composition of remote regions [ ; ; ; ; ], into trace gas emissions [ ; ; ; ; ; ], and into surface air quality [ ; ; ]. However, accurate description of the surface reflectivity is needed for retrievals of trace gases, clouds, and aerosol in the UV‐Vis. The retrieval of trace gas abundances commonly begins with a spectral fit that is applied to distinctive absorption bands in the measured reflectance spectra [ ; ]. The observed absorption is used to calculate the slant column (SC), a measure of the total amount of trace gas along the path of the backscattered sunlight captured by the satellite instrument. A slant column is converted into a vertical column (VC), the integrated column above the surface, through use of an air mass factor (AMF) such that VC = SC/AMF [ ]. The AMF accounts for the varying vertical sensitivity of the measurement, which depends on the light path through the atmosphere, the surface reflectivity, the trace gas vertical profile, clouds, and aerosols. In practice, the AMF is estimated using imperfect knowledge of these parameters and radiative transfer in the atmosphere. Previous studies have found a high sensitivity of the retrieval to surface reflectivity. estimate an error of 10%–20% in their SO 2 columns for an error of 0.02 in the surface reflectivity over land. For this same error in the surface reflectivity, estimate an error of 15% in the derived tropospheric NO 2 column for polluted scenes. For a typical scene, estimate an error of 0.02 in the cloud fraction due to an error of 0.02 in the surface reflectivity. The reflectivity of snow is an important parameter in satellite‐based estimation of surface UV irradiance [ ]. Several global climatologies of surface reflectivity have been created from long‐term data sets of measured radiances from TOMS [ ], GOME [ ], and OMI [ ]. Statistics are applied to the long‐term data set to remove the effects of clouds and aerosols from measured reflectivity. This statistical cloud screening could lead to ambiguity in the absolute surface reflectivity. The NASA A‐Train is a formation of several specialized satellites flying in close proximity which includes the instruments OMI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The wealth of information provided by these instruments over the same locations at nearly the same time grants an unprecedented opportunity to infer surface reflectivity, without statistical methods to eliminate clouds, and to evaluate the above data sets. Clouds and the surface often are modeled as opaque Lambertian reflectors for the purpose of satellite retrievals [ ]. In this approach, the wavelength specific, normalized backscattered radiance at the top of the atmosphere I TOA is given by [ , equation 6.16; ] _placeholder_formula_ where R is the Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) of the cloud or surface, I g is the total irradiance reaching the surface, γ is the transmittance of the atmosphere to reflected radiance, and S b is the fraction of the reflected irradiance (or flux) that the atmosphere scatters back toward the reflector. The independent pixel approximation is used to deal with partially cloudy scenes. In this approximation, the total observed radiance ( I Total ) is the sum of the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiances of the clear ( I clear ) and cloudy ( I cloud ) subpixels weighted by a cloud fraction ( f ). The total observed radiance is then expressed as _placeholder_formula_ For UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals, the cloud fraction is determined by comparing the observed TOA radiance to the modeled clear‐sky TOA radiance based on the climatological surface reflectivity. A deficit in the modeled TOA radiance is accounted for by clouds (which are typically more reflective than the surface). In practice, a small, highly reflective cloud and a large, semitransparent cloud with the same total reflectivity are indistinguishable. For this reason, the reflectivity of the modeled cloud is fixed and only the cloud fraction is allowed to vary. The cloud fraction (or effective cloud fraction) is thus a combination of the true geometrical cloud fraction and the cloud reflectivity. Typical choices for the cloud reflectivity are 0.6 and 0.8, which correspond to optically thick (highly reflective) clouds. An optimal Lambertian cloud model will approximate the transmission and reflection of a real cloud [ ]. Snow cover poses a significant challenge for solar backscatter measurements of trace gases, as it can greatly change the radiative properties of the surface on short time scales (hours). The lack of contrast between snow and cloud in the UV‐Vis also makes it difficult to infer cloud cover. In this work, we use cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered observations from OMI to determine global surface reflectivity under both snow‐covered and snow‐free conditions. provides a brief description of the satellite instruments and data sets used in our analysis. describes our cloud and aerosol screening techniques and applies them to retrieve the global surface reflectivity. assesses the surface reflectivity over snow‐covered lands. investigates the implications of our snow‐covered surface reflectivity on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using NO 2 as an example. Instruments and Data The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is a Dutch/Finnish imaging spectrograph that measures the solar and Earth radiance spectrum from 270 to 500 nm [ ]. OMI has a ground pixel resolution of 13 km × 24 km at nadir and a 114° swath, which allows for daily global coverage. OMI is on board the NASA Aura satellite that launched in July 2004. Aura is part of the A‐Train constellation of satellites in polar orbits with equator crossing times near 1330 local time. NO 2 is retrieved from OMI measurements over 405–465 nm where NO 2 absorbs strongly, and there is little interference from other trace gases. Two OMI NO 2 products exist, the standard product [ ] and the DOMINO product [ ]. There are also two OMI cloud products [ ; ]. Both NO 2 retrievals use a cloud product based on absorption from the O 2 ‐O 2 collision complex (OMCLDO2) [ ; ]. The currently available Collection 3 products originally used surface LERs taken from the climatology of , based on 5.5 years of GOME measurements. Use of the LER climatology has been implemented as of orbit number 24349 (11 February 2009) in both NO 2 products and is planned for future versions of the NO 2 products. The OMI cloud and NO 2 retrievals use the near real‐time ice concentration and snow extent (NISE) data set ( , updated daily) to infer snow coverage. The NISE data set uses microwave measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument on board the DMSP F13 satellite. Because of its near‐polar, Sun‐synchronous orbit, the frequency of observations by the SSM/I is greater than 1/d above 55°. The principle of the snow detection algorithm is based on the scattering of microwave radiation, emitted from the underlying soil, by snow grains [ , ; ]. Wet snow emits microwave radiation similar to the underlying surface and so is not detected in this way. The NISE data set has not been validated but is known to consistently miss thin snow cover. A snow flag is provided in the OMI product, which indicates if a scene contains dry snow according to the NISE data set. For many scenes flagged as dry snow by the NISE data set, the current OMI cloud and NO 2 retrievals replace the climatological surface LER with a value of 0.6 to account for increased reflectivity due to snow. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an instrument currently on board two NASA satellites, Terra and Aqua. MODIS measures radiances in 36 spectral bands from 0.415 to 14.235 μ m at high spatial resolution [ ]. The nadir spatial resolution varies between bands from 250 to 1 km. Each MODIS instrument takes measurements over the entire globe every 1–2 days. Aqua was launched in May 2002 into a near‐polar, Sun‐synchronous orbit with a 1330 local overpass time. It was the first member of the A‐Train. In this study, we use three MODIS Collection 5 Level‐2 data products: the cloud mask [ ], the cloud optical depth [ ], and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) [ ]. The AOD product uses the first seven spectral bands (0.47–2.13 μ m), while the cloud products use additional bands at infrared wavelengths. Recent validation studies indicate that the MODIS cloud mask performs well except over polar regions at night [ ; ]. The MODIS cloud mask follows a separate set of tests when the possibility of snow is detected. These snow‐covered scenes are of particular interest to the current study. In their comparison with an arctic ground‐based lidar and radar, report that during the day MODIS/Terra misidentifies 2.7% of cloudy scenes as clear sky and 6.9% clear‐sky scenes as cloudy. Climatology of Cloud‐ and Aerosol‐Filtered Snow‐Free Surface LER Development of the Climatology The retrieval of surface reflectivity from OMI measurements requires accurate assessment of the fraction of TOA radiance that was reflected by atmospheric constituents versus the fraction from the surface. In particular, information is needed about clouds and aerosols, which are spatially inhomogeneous and significantly reflective. Because the OMI cloud and aerosol products depend on the a priori surface reflectivity, additional information is required to retrieve the surface reflectivity. In this study, the MODIS cloud and aerosol masks are used to determine the presence of clouds and aerosols within the OMI field of view. Using MODIS to screen the atmospheric constituents permits detection of clear‐sky OMI scenes without the use of statistical methods to eliminate cloud and aerosol contamination, even when surface LER is unknown. We regrid the MODIS cloud mask onto a 0.25° × 0.25° grid for each orbit. All grid cells containing measurements flagged as cloudy or uncertain in the MODIS cloud mask are designated as cloudy. We account for horizontal displacement of the clouds during the time between the MODIS and OMI overpass ( t MODIS‐OMI ∼ 15 min) by flagging all grid squares, to which a cloud could have propagated, as potentially cloudy. We use the maximum tropospheric wind vectors ( v max ) at the cloud location from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System GEOS 5 assimilated meteorological data. For each cloudy grid cell, all grid cells up to a distance v max × t MODIS‐OMI away in each direction are also flagged as contaminated. We similarly use the MODIS AOD product to screen for aerosol. All 0.25° grid points containing a pixel with an AOD greater than 0.2 are flagged as contaminated and allowed to propagate to a distance v max × t MODIS‐OMI . Lowering the tolerance for AOD to 0.05 yields no noticeable difference in the remaining results. We apply the cloud/aerosol mask to check each OMI pixel in the same orbit for possible contamination. OMI pixels that do not intersect a flagged cell are considered clear‐sky scenes. OMI pixels that extend beyond the MODIS swath are rejected. We use this database of cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered OMI scenes to create a climatology of surface reflectivity. For clear‐sky scenes, the retrieval of the surface LER becomes a simple inversion of , where I TOA ( R = 0) is equal to the Rayleigh scattering of the atmosphere. We use the scene LERs provided in the OMI Rotational Raman (OMCLDRR) cloud product [ ] at 354 nm (346–354 nm) as measurements of surface LER for cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered scenes. When the OMCLDRR cloud fraction is less than 5%, the LER model is used (as opposed to the mixed LER approach) and an effective scene pressure is retrieved. This is the case for the majority of our cloud‐free scenes; however, greater cloud fractions remain due to incorrect characterization of the surface reflectivity in the cloud retrieval. We eliminate scenes with retrieved pressures that differ by more than 100 hPa from the surface pressure to further exclude residual aerosols and clouds that prevent light from traveling through the full extent of the atmosphere (removes 23% of remaining measurements). We exclude data that are flagged as potentially affected by Sun glint (removes 24% of remaining measurements) and use the NISE data set to eliminate snow cover. Finally, we exclude outliers with scene LERs greater than 0.3 to eliminate residual snow cover and remaining occurrences of direct reflection. This last criterion removes 0.14% of the remaining measurements. shows the mean measured surface reflectivity using 3 years of data (2005, 2006, and 2007) at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. Ocean surface LERs are typically in the range of 0.05–0.10. The reflectivity of oceans is largely governed by suspended particles and phytoplankton since water itself absorbs weakly at UV wavelengths [ ; ]. Over land the surface LER is typically in the range of 0.01–0.10. Absorption by chlorophyll leads to vegetated regions being darker, whereas deserts are brighter (LERs up to 0.2). Shadowing in mountainous regions causes the LER to reach values near zero. White areas indicate where persistent cloud or aerosol lead to little or no data after filtering. Between 60°N and 60°S, 20% of the grid cells in contain less than 10 valid measurements. We estimate the precision on the values in by examining the variability of the measured LERs in each grid cell. Over land, the standard error of the mean is typically 0.005. This estimate includes contributions from the subpixel variation in surface LER and variation in the bidirectional reflectance function. Over oceans, where there are fewer measurements, the standard error increases to 0.01. Radiometric uncertainty additionally contributes to the total error. Comparison With Existing Climatologies We use our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered surface LER data set to evaluate three previous climatologies used in satellite retrievals of atmospheric constituents. derive surface LERs at 1° × 1.25° resolution based on minimum observed radiances in the 340–380 nm window from 14.5 years of TOMS data (henceforth referred to as TOMS MinLER). derive surface LERs at 1° × 1° resolution based on minimum observed radiances from GOME over a 5.5 year period (henceforth referred to as GOME MinLER). We interpolate between the GOME MinLER values at 335 and 380 nm to estimate the LERs at 354 nm before comparing to our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered reflectivities. produce two climatologies of surface reflectivity at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution from 3 years of OMI radiances. The first climatology is also based on minimum observed radiances (henceforth referred to as OMI MinLER). They argue, however, that the minimum surface LER may not be the most appropriate value since the minimum could occur due to darkening by precipitation or shading from cloud or ground. Also, the minimum is likely to select the lowest value in the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). For their second climatology (henceforth referred to as OMI LER), a histogram of measured scene LERs is created for each grid point around the globe. The surface LER is typically chosen as either the mode or the 1% cumulative probable value of the histogram. The OMI LER product allows for more than minimal seasonal snow cover. We ignore regions where this is permitted in our evaluation with our strictly snow‐free climatology. We calculate the surface LERs from our cloud‐free data set at the resolution of each of the four climatologies. We calculate monthly differences between our product and these previous climatologies and then average to produce seasonal and annual differences. summarizes the comparison. All four of the annual global mean climatologies are within 0.01 of our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. Our product is more consistent with the OMI LER product than the OMI MinLER product. This supports the selection of surface LERs using a histogram rather than choosing the minimum. However, when scenes with more than minimal seasonal snow cover are included, the OMI LER is less consistent with our data set (mean difference, 0.01; standard deviation, 0.07). The GOME MinLER climatology is higher on average by 0.01 than our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. A possible explanation is residual cloud in the GOME climatology that arises from the large pixel size and the relatively few measurements used in constructing the climatology. The 14.5 year data set used in the construction of the TOMS MinLER yields lower surface LERs than our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. Differences in radiometric calibration could contribute to interinstrument differences. The difference in local overpass times between OMI (1345), TOMS (∼1200), and GOME (1030) is unlikely to explain the observed discrepancies since the OMI‐TOMS difference is opposite in sign from the OMI‐GOME difference. shows the mean seasonal differences in surface LER between our product and three of the previous climatologies; OMI MinLER is omitted. Differences with the OMI LER climatology for remote oceans are typically within 0.01, while coastal OMI LER values tend to be lower by up to 0.03. Vegetated regions over land are generally higher in the OMI LER product by 0.01–0.02. In regions where higher dust loading is expected [ ], the OMI LER is generally lower by 0.01–0.03. Suspended dust lowers the apparent reflectivity [ ; ] and could contribute to the difference. Although we screen for aerosols using MODIS AOD and by neglecting measurements with high scene pressures, persistent thin aerosol layers could still affect our product. This implies the difference between OMI LER and the true LER could be even larger. The GOME and TOMS MinLER climatologies are distinctly lower in areas of enhanced dust aerosol. In particular, TOMS MinLER is lower by more then 0.1 over the deserts of Saudi Arabia between March and August. GOME MinLER is higher for oceans by up to 0.04. Seasonal snow cover could contribute to the discrepancies at northern high latitudes where GOME MinLER is up to 0.1 higher. Climatology of Snow‐Covered Surface LER Here we develop a climatology of snow‐covered surface LER and examine its dependence on season and vegetation before comparing with previous climatologies. Data Set Development We first evaluate the usefulness of using the NISE data set to determine if an OMI scene is snow covered by comparing the snow flag to collocated ground‐based measurements of snow depth. Snow‐on‐ground data are from the Canadian Daily Climate Data collected by Environment Canada ( ) at the Calgary and Edmonton airports. These cities were chosen for the homogeneity of the surrounding land (no nearby large bodies of water) and occurrence of both snow‐covered and snow‐free scenes. The ground‐based measurements are determined to be collocated with the OMI measurement if the OMI pixel center is within 0.5° (∼50 km) of the airport. We divide snow depths into three categories: snow free, thin snow (up to 5 cm), and thick snow (more than 5 cm.) Data from the months of November, December, January, February, and March of 2005 and 2006 (10 months in total) are used in this comparison. This corresponds to a total of 8173 OMI pixels, 53% flagged as dry snow and 47% flagged as snow free. Snow cover data for April were unavailable for most airports. shows the fraction of ground‐based observations which fall into each of the three snow depth categories as a function of the NISE snow flag. Only 6% of the measurements with the NISE dry snow classification showed no snow on ground for that day at the nearby airport. However, for measurements with the snow‐free classification, 69% had at least some snow on ground for that day at the nearby airport and 20% had snow depths of more than 5 cm. We conclude that the NISE dry snow classification is a good indication that a scene contains snow but that the snow‐free classification is unreliable in regions that could contain seasonal snow cover. Spatial sampling bias is an unlikely explanation. Increasing the collocation criteria to 0.1° (∼10 km) decreases to 5% (215 observations) the fraction of dry snow scenes with no snow on ground but increases to 74% (207 observations) the fraction of snow‐free scenes with at least some snow on ground. We develop a data set of snow‐covered surface reflectivity by using the mean surface LER viewed by OMI for scenes that are cloud free, as determined with the MODIS cloud mask, and snow covered, as flagged in the OMI product according to the NISE data set. (top) shows the mean observed LER of seasonal snow covered lands at 354 nm. The resulting LER depends strongly on the local vegetation type. The transition from the northern Canadian boreal forest (LER ∼ 0.4) through the taiga to the arctic tundra (LER ∼ 0.9) demonstrates the role of tall vegetation in masking the highly reflective snow [ ]. The prairies of central North America and Asia are highly reflective (LER ∼ 0.8). Mountainous regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau, exhibit non‐Lambertian behavior and have low LERs (∼0.1) even when snow is present. Low LER values in the southeastern United States may arise from transient snow and a temporal mismatch of a few days between the SSM/I and OMI observations. Strict cloud screening leads to the rejection of nearly all OMI data over many locations in winter months. To increase the spatial extent of our data set, we relax the cloud screening algorithm. Our cloud‐filtered data set is extended by only designating grid cells as contaminated if they contain clouds with optical depths greater than one. We account for the horizontal displacement of these optically thick clouds as before. (bottom) shows the mean surface LERs calculated using this relaxed cloud screening criteria. The LERs from this expanded data set are similar to those from the strictly cloudless data though the spatial coverage is improved. Forested regions have mean LERs as low as 0.3 even in the presence of snow. We examined the effect of relaxing the cloud screening criteria by comparing the newly accepted LER measurements to those that are part of the strictly cloud‐free data set. The two data sets typically agree to within 0.05. Exceptions are over the bright prairies where clouds reduce the LER by approximately 0.1 and over the Tibetan Plateau where clouds increase the surface LER by approximately 0.15. We examine the temporal variability in the snow‐covered LER to estimate the potential of using the expanded data set as a reliable measure of the snow‐covered surface reflectivity. Standard deviations of the LERs throughout Canada and Russia are typically less than 0.15. These low standard deviations indicate that the surface reflectivity of snow‐covered surfaces is represented within 10%–20%. Higher standard deviations of up to 0.3 to the south indicate that snow‐covered surface reflectivity is difficult to predict in regions with thin or transient snow. Sensitivity to Vegetation Here we examine the dependence of our expanded snow‐covered surface LER data set on the underlying vegetation type. We use the MODIS land cover product (MOD12C1) to determine the percentage of each International Geosphere‐Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover type in each grid cell. We mask mountainous regions due to their non‐Lambertian behavior. We then estimate the reflectivity of the various snow‐covered land types in two different ways. The first method uses only pixels containing at least 95% of a single vegetation type. The second uses the maximum land cover type of each grid cell. This corresponds to the land cover type that occupies the largest fraction of the grid cell. shows the LER of the snow‐covered land types calculated in these two different ways. The differences between the mean LERs using the two methods reflect both the low sampling over some land cover types and the complex interaction of the vegetation types in determining the overall optical properties of the surface. The large variation with vegetation type has been well documented [ ; ; ]. This is due to the tops of the vegetation that extend beyond the snow‐covered surface, thus partially obscuring the highly reflective snow from the satellite instrument [ ]. also includes vegetation dependence from previous work. provide snow‐covered LER estimates for locations containing at least 95% of a single vegetation type. Our results are similar except for cropland, which corresponds to largely different regions in their land cover type database when compared to the MODIS land cover product. provide snow‐covered albedo estimates for various maximum land types. Their results are consistent with ours with the exception of the albedo over deciduous broadleaf forests. This land cover type is the least sampled in our data set and may not be well represented. Seasonal Variation The reflectivity of snow‐covered lands further depends on several factors that change with time. We assess the seasonal variation of the snow‐covered surface LERs using the monthly mean from grid cells that contain data for all 6 months, November through April. shows the observed mean seasonal variation in LER of snow‐covered surfaces in the Northern Hemisphere. Reflectivity increases until January and then decreases through to April. The reflectivity of snow increases with solar zenith angle [ ]; however, argue that snow depth is the most crucial parameter in determining variation in the surface reflectivity. Deposition of soot and increase in grain size also lower the reflectivity of snow as it ages [ ]. During the melting season, the LER drops by 0.1, likely due to decreases in snow depth. Temporal mismatch between OMI and SSM/I may further contribute to the decrease in reflectivity. Comparison With Existing Climatologies shows the difference between our snow‐covered surface reflectivity database versus the three previous climatologies in winter months. GOME and TOMS MinLER are, by design, measures of the surface LER under conditions of minimal snow cover. This leads to both climatologies being lower than our snow‐covered surface reflectivities. The OMI LER product allows for more than minimal snow cover in their surface reflectivities leading to LERs that are more consistent with our snow‐covered surface LERs. However, regions such as the plains of south central Canada remain with large differences because of irregular but highly reflective snow cover. Locations where our snow‐covered surface LER data set is lower than the OMI LER product, such as the Pacific coast of Canada and Eastern Europe, could indicate cloud contamination in the OMI LER product in winter months, since the surface reflectivity is expected to be at a maximum when snow is present. The large differences between our snow‐covered product and all three previous climatologies demonstrate the difficulty in using a single value for the surface LER, in regions where seasonal snow cover is potentially present. It is therefore desirable to have two separate LERs in retrievals of atmospheric constituents: one for the snow‐free case and one for the snow‐covered case. UV‐Vis Trace Gas Retrievals Over Snow Trace gas retrievals using solar backscatter over regions of seasonal snow often are considered unreliable due to the difficulty in detecting snow, the uncertainty in its reflectivity, and the difficulty in detecting clouds in the presence of snow. Should these difficulties be overcome, a snow‐covered scene provides a better trace gas measurement than a snow‐free scene. We explore the effect of snow on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using tropospheric NO 2 as an example. Our snow‐covered surface LER database is measured at 354 nm, whereas the OMI NO 2 retrieval is centered on 435 nm. However, the wavelength difference is of little consequence for our analysis due to the weak spectral dependence of snow in the UV‐Vis. report that the albedo of a thin snow layer (2 cm) on grass rises from 0.656 at 350 nm to 0.678 at 440 nm. In the data set compiled by , we find a mean difference of 0.006 between the surface reflectivities at 354 and 440 nm in regions where snow is observed. shows the effect of surface reflectivity on the random error in the AMF for tropospheric NO 2 . Tropospheric AMFs are calculated for each surface reflectivity using a modeled NO 2 profile over the city of Edmonton, Canada. The tropospheric column errors are then generated using the formulation of . Error in the tropospheric AMF is often the dominant term in polluted regions. indicates that for cloud‐free scenes over cities the random error in the tropospheric AMF decreases from 25% over a nonreflective surface to 3% over a surface with a reflectivity of 0.4. This improvement is due to the increased sensitivity to the lower atmosphere, where the majority of the NO 2 column is located. shows the OMI tropospheric NO 2 column (including NO 2 below cloud) from the standard product [ ] over the cities of Calgary and Edmonton for the three different snow‐on‐ground categories described in . OMI NO 2 columns over thick snow are 60% larger than those over snow‐free surfaces. NO 2 columns in conditions reported as completely cloudy are a factor of four larger than those for cloud‐free conditions. We compare to hourly in situ measurements taken at various locations in the two cities as part of the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. In contrast, these ground‐based measurements exhibit only 13% higher NO 2 concentrations over thick snow compared to snow free and have no trend ( r = 0.15) with reported cloud fraction. The bias arises from both false cloud detection and underestimates in surface reflectivity as discussed below. Errors in the a priori surface reflectivity will introduce errors in the OMI cloud fraction retrieval, so we make the distinction between the cloud fractions reported in the OMI product and real cloud fractions. The surface LER affects the AMF calculation both directly and through the cloud retrieval. Both of these aspects need to be considered when correcting the NO 2 retrieval over snow for errors in the a priori surface LER. We address the direct effect by using our climatology of snow‐covered surface LERs and the cloud effect by only using scenes from our expanded cloud‐free data set. For each of these cloud‐free scenes, two AMFs are calculated at 440 nm. The first is calculated with the original surface LER and reported cloud fraction. The second (corrected) AMF is calculated using our snow‐covered surface LER and a cloud fraction of zero. Relative differences in these two AMFs are used to infer relative biases in the tropospheric NO 2 column for scenes flagged as snow covered. Both OMI NO 2 retrievals (standard and DOMINO) currently use the same cloud and surface LER data so our results are applicable to both products. (top) shows the mean relative bias in the OMI NO 2 retrieval over snow. Retrievals over highly reflective snow‐covered grasslands overestimate the tropospheric NO 2 column by more than 100%. These regions exhibit large underestimates of the surface reflectivity for snow‐covered scenes ( ), which leads to underestimates in the sensitivity to NO 2 in the lower atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to overestimates in the total NO 2 column. Elsewhere, blue regions in (top) reveal underestimates in the NO 2 columns over snow that arise from overestimates in the surface LER. Snow‐related bias in the NO 2 retrieval is smaller in the northernmost regions where snow cover is better represented. Though only cloud‐free scenes (as inferred from MODIS) are used in this analysis, nonzero cloud fractions are commonly reported in the OMICLDO2 product due to errors in the a priori surface LER. In snow‐covered regions, the lack of contrast between cloud and surface exacerbates this problem. We find that any cloud fraction can be reported in OMICLDO2, even for MODIS‐determined cloud‐free scenes. In a typical study of mean NO 2 columns, scenes with cloud fractions greater than a certain threshold (for example, 0.3 or 0.5) are rejected to ensure sensitivity to the surface in all measurements. (bottom) shows the mean bias in the OMI tropospheric NO 2 retrieval for (MODIS determined) cloud‐free scenes when an OMI cloud fraction threshold of 0.3 is applied. The overestimates evident in (top) are reduced to less than 20%. This is because an underestimate of the surface reflectivity yields an overestimate in the cloud fraction, which increases the likelihood that the scene will be rejected as cloudy. The low biased regions in (top) are, however, largely unaltered because an overestimate in surface reflectivity will ensure a cloud fraction of zero is reported. Though this study is confined to cloud‐free scenes, the trend of underestimating NO 2 in regions where the surface reflectivity is overestimated and rejecting scenes where the surface reflectivity is underestimated will persist for most partially cloudy scenes. This implies that mean NO 2 columns tend to be underestimated over snow‐covered surfaces where the surface LER is poorly characterized. Future cloud and trace gas retrievals would benefit from a separate surface LER database for snow‐covered scenes. The general effects found here for NO 2 should be similar for other trace gas retrievals in the UV‐Vis. Conclusion We have created a database of surface reflectivity at 354 nm using observations from two satellite instruments in the A‐Train. MODIS/Aqua observations were used to identify and exclude scenes contaminated by cloud and aerosol. OMI observations of the resultant clear‐sky scenes were used to determine the Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) of both snow‐free and snow‐covered lands. We applied this database to evaluate previous surface LER climatologies from TOMS, GOME, and OMI. Our snow‐free cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered surface LERs, where available, agree well (mean difference, 0.0002; standard deviation, 0.011) with the OMI LER [ ] climatology. Differences of up to 0.05 remain over regions with a large dust influence. Other climatologies which select the minimum observed LER as the surface LER, exhibit greater discrepancies (mean difference >0.002; standard deviation >0.02) versus our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered data set. Our analysis focused on LER, as currently used in OMI retrievals. In reality, the surface reflectivity has angular dependence. An improved description of the surface reflectivity, which better characterizes the bidirectional reflectance function, should improve future retrievals using solar backscatter. We evaluated surface LER characteristics for snow‐covered lands at 354 nm. Our snow‐covered surface reflectivity database depends strongly on the underlying vegetation. Surface LERs range from 0.3 for some forested regions to 0.8 over shrubland. The mean LER of snow‐covered lands in the Northern Hemisphere increases by 0.1 from November to January and decreases by 0.1 through March. None of the previous climatologies used in trace gas retrievals agree well with our mean snow‐covered surface LERs in winter months. This is largely by design as TOMS MinLER and GOME MinLER report the surface LERs for minimum snow cover. OMI LER allows for a contribution to the surface LER by snow, but this leads to some cloud contamination in winter months. Furthermore, including seasonal snow in the climatological surface LER leads to ambiguity in surface LER and therefore in trace gas retrievals over snow. We propose the use of a separate surface LER database for snow‐covered scenes. We investigated the effect of seasonal snow cover on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using NO 2 as an example. The weak spectral dependence of snow in the UV‐Vis allows application of our data set at 354 nm for OMI NO 2 retrievals at 440 nm. OMI NO 2 retrievals over central Canada exhibit dependence on cloud and snow that is inconsistent with in situ measurements. Underestimates in the snow‐covered surface reflectivity lead to overestimates in the OMI NO 2 and cloud fraction retrievals, even when no clouds are present in the field of view of the instrument. These scenes tend to get rejected by cloud fraction filters due to the overestimated cloud fractions. Conversely, overestimates of the surface reflectivity lead to underestimates in both the OMI NO 2 and cloud fraction retrievals. These scenes are then preferentially accepted by cloud fraction filters because of the artificially low cloud fractions. The net effect is that NO 2 columns tend to be underestimated over seasonal snow‐covered lands if a cloud fraction filter is applied. Random errors in the surface reflectivity will also lead to systematic underestimates in the NO 2 column when a cloud fraction filter is used. This is because scenes where the surface reflectivity is underestimated tend to underestimate NO 2 and are preferentially selected by the cloud fraction filter. If well characterized, snow increases the sensitivity of UV‐Vis retrievals to trace gases in the lower troposphere. However, snow detection is challenging, and we find that the NISE snow‐free classification is less reliable for OMI scenes in regions containing thin snow cover. OMI products could benefit from the use of a validated data set such as the MODIS snow cover product [ ]. Emerging snow/ice/cloud data from SCIAMACHY [ ; ] may be useful for future work. We did not explore the effects of scenes that are incorrectly flagged (either as snow covered or snow free) on the retrieved mean NO 2 columns. In addition, partially cloudy scenes could be affected to a different degree than the clear‐sky scenes used in our comparisons. For these reasons, our results should only be used as guidelines for assessing the effect of snow on the OMI NO 2 retrieval and not as a quantitative measure of the overall bias due to snow. Future satellite missions to measure trace gases using solar backscatter would benefit from additional discrete spectral bands at longer wavelengths to improve discrimination between cloud and snow.

Strong upward motions associated with storms rapidly transport gases emitted at the surface to the midtroposphere and upper troposphere where atmospheric residence times are typically increased. Stronger winds at high altitudes may also facilitate transport over greater distances from source regions than if species had remained near the surface [e.g., ; ; ]. Some extreme convective events can cause mixing across the tropopause [e.g., ], altering the concentrations of radiatively active trace gases in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. A recent modeling study by suggests that convection penetrating the stratosphere can strongly influence upper tropospheric ozone mixing ratios over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude continents in summer. GCMs are typically run at resolutions too low to resolve individual convective events meaning that convective processes must be parameterized; this remains one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in weather and climate simulations [ ]. Much uncertainty surrounds the role of convection in relation to other transport processes such as turbulence or advection by the large‐scale atmospheric circulation. Contributing to this uncertainty is the fact that the representation of convection varies widely among models. For example, showed that the use of different convective schemes in a single GCM could strongly impact the distribution of precipitation as well as the atmospheric energy budget. used three different sets of meteorological fields to drive offline chemical transport model (CTM) simulations of radionuclide transport. Their results showed that the role played by convective transport varied substantially among the different meteorological fields. Several studies of the effect of convection on tropospheric ozone underscore the uncertainties associated with the process. estimated that convection increases the tropospheric ozone burden by 12% due to the transport of ozone precursors from the boundary layer to the middle and upper troposphere where they are longer lived and more efficient at producing ozone. In contrast, found that convection decreases the tropospheric ozone burden by 13% due to the upward transport of lower ozone air near the surface to altitudes where the lifetime of ozone is extended and the downward mixing of higher ozone air to lower altitudes where it is more rapidly destroyed. suggest that much of the difference between the results of the two studies may stem from the large differences in the height and intensity of deep convection. discuss the difficulties faced by these types of sensitivity studies, because transport by convection is treated by the convective parameterization while a component of the large‐scale flow occurs in convective updrafts such as those found in the Walker and Hadley cells. In particular, within the deep convective parameterization, updraft mass fluxes are balanced by subsidence within the same column while in reality these motions form part of the large‐scale circulation, a point also discussed by . As a consequence, the role of convective transport in determining trace gas distributions cannot be properly determined by simply shutting off transport by convective mass flux as in the and studies because the component of the convection associated with the large‐scale flow is untreated. While substantial differences exist between different convective schemes and their implementation in various GCMs, significant uncertainty can be introduced into simulated trace gas distributions by the assumptions made within a single scheme. showed how varying parameter settings in the Relaxed Arakawa‐Schubert (RAS) convection module impacts tropical precipitation patterns in the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS‐5) GCM. compared simulations of several thunderstorms observed during different field projects by cloud‐resolving models (CRMs) and by a single‐column model (SCM) version of the GEOS‐5 GCM. In addition to comparisons with cloud‐resolving model results, the study examined the issue of parameter sensitivity within the GEOS‐5 moist physics code. The results showed that the strong impacts of the parameter settings on convective mass fluxes affect vertical trace gas distributions in the single‐column model. In this work, we seek to better understand the role of convective transport in determining atmospheric CO distributions, emphasizing the uncertainty introduced into simulations of atmospheric composition through different tunings (parameter settings) in a single convective scheme. This is done by analyzing an ensemble of simulations constructed using alterations to parameter settings in the model's moist physics schemes. of this paper describes the model used and details the parameter sensitivity experiments. In , we examine the impact of parameter sensitivity on simulated CO distributions. presents a summary and conclusions to be drawn from this work. Model Experiments Description of the GEOS‐5 AGCM The GEOS‐5 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) has been developed as a flexible tool to represent the atmosphere on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. It is a central component of the GEOS‐5 atmospheric data assimilation system [ ], where it is used with half‐degree spatial resolution for meteorological analysis and forecasting [ ]. It has also been developed as a tool for studying atmospheric composition and climate. The AGCM combines the finite volume dynamical core described by with the GEOS‐5 column physics package, summarized by . The model domain extends from the surface to 0.01 hPa and uses 72 hybrid layers that transition from terrain‐following near the surface to pure pressure levels above 180 hPa. In this study, the horizontal resolution is 1° × 1.25° (latitude by longitude) and the time step is 30 min for physical computations, with more frequent computations of resolved‐scale transport in the dynamical core. The eight‐member ensemble of simulations presented in this work consists of 4 year simulations from 2000 to 2003. Moist processes in GEOS‐5 are represented by a convective parameterization and prognostic cloud scheme. Convection is parameterized using the Relaxed Arakawa‐Schubert (RAS) scheme of , a modified version of the Arakawa‐Schubert scheme [ ], in which the atmosphere is relaxed toward quasi‐equilibrium, reducing the convective available potential energy (CAPE) as it is produced by large‐scale processes. RAS represents convection as a sequence of linearly entraining plumes sharing the same base level but characterized by unique detrainment levels. All levels between the cloud base and 100 hPa are tested for the possibility of convection by calculating the cloud base mass flux for each plume using a CAPE‐based closure. This mass flux is used to modify environmental temperature and moisture profiles; subsequent plumes receive the modified sounding. Consequently, the convective mass flux considered here represents the collective effect of updrafts produced by the ensemble of plumes. The effect of each convective updraft plume on tracers consists of two parts. In‐plume upward transport directly changes the grid box tracer value through cloud top detrainment [ ]. This process can lead for example to the sudden appearance of boundary layer tracers near the tropopause during a single time step. Next, compensating subsidence in the plume‐free environment induces further changes through downward advection of tracer. This subsidence is a design feature of mass‐flux convection parameterizations and should not be confused with explicit downdrafts. Convective downdrafts are not included in this version of the model but are in development for future versions. RAS calculates profiles of convective condensate within supersaturated plumes by reducing humidity by the amount necessary to achieve saturation. The prognostic cloud scheme contained in GEOS‐5 calculates large‐scale ice and liquid condensate by assuming a probability distribution function (pdf) of total water. Condensate is removed from the domain by evaporation, autoconversion of liquid condensate, sedimentation of frozen condensate, and accretion of condensate by falling precipitation. The version of GEOS‐5 used in this work includes transport, emission, and chemical loss of CO. Biomass burning emissions of CO follow the GFED‐2 inventory described by which is based on TRMM and MODIS observations of hot spots and burned area; emissions are prescribed monthly and reflect the interannual variability of fire activity. Fossil fuel emissions follow while biofuel emissions of CO are described by . Biofuel and fossil fuel emissions over Asia are increased by 46% to account for recent increases in emissions [ ]; this includes a 39% increase in direct emission of CO and an additional 7% increase to represent CO produced by hydrocarbon photochemistry not represented in the simplified chemistry scheme. These changes were based on the work of who analyzed forward and inverse modeling studies of CO emission and transport over Asia during several field campaigns. In addition to direct emissions, CO is produced photochemically from methane and nonmethane hydrocarbons as described by . While CO emissions from biomass burning vary interannually, monthly emissions from fossil fuels, biofuels, and hydrocarbon oxidation do not. Loss of CO occurs through reaction with OH using a prescribed loss frequency. Monthly mean OH fields are taken from a simulation of the year 2001 by the GMI model [ ] and are not affected by reaction with CO. Recent work by suggests that the interannual variability of OH is small when annual means are considered; they estimate interannual variability in global tropospheric OH of 0.9 ± 0.8% based on model simulations. Though interannual variability of OH may be small, differences in OH over smaller time scales may be considerably larger because OH is affected by emissions; for example, showed that OH abundance over Indonesia was significantly altered by CO emissions from the massive 1997 fire outbreak. This simplified treatment of chemistry [ ] allows focus on transport effects, but does limit the potential for such feedbacks between convective transport and CO chemistry on the OH distribution. Trace gases are transported online in GEOS‐5 using the dynamical core for resolved scales; turbulent mixing of CO is performed in the same way as for moisture (using the boundary layer turbulence module); and using RAS for convective transport. Convective transport is calculated by allowing each plume in RAS to successively modify the vertical trace gas profiles, in the same way that environmental temperature and moisture profiles are modified, to represent the collective effects of an ensemble of clouds of differing heights which could coexist within a model grid cell. The Control Simulation Global simulations were carried out using the GEOS‐5 AGCM in “free‐running” mode. In this mode, the model reads prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice distributions, which are obtained from observations [ ]. Atmospheric observations are not assimilated. Such simulations generally produce direct SST‐forced variations that agree, in monthly and seasonal means, with the climate for the years of the input SSTs (in this case, 2000–2003), but do not reproduce specific weather features such as fronts or storm systems. Such simulations also do not generally represent extratropical circulations, such as stationary wave patterns, that are well aligned with those of any particular year in the real atmosphere. As a result, we focus on monthly and seasonal average results. A control simulation was conducted in which the GEOS‐5 AGCM was configured with default parameter settings of the GEOS‐5.1.0 version [ ]. Relevant information about this will be discussed in the context of the ensemble of perturbation experiments. Atmospheric carbon monoxide, with imposed emissions and simple atmospheric loss computations, was included in the AGCM. To set the context for this work, a brief overview of the simulated CO is presented. shows a comparison of simulated column CO data from GEOS‐5 with observations obtained from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) [ ] instrument aboard the EOS Terra satellite. The MOPITT product used is monthly mean version 4 level 2 data [ ] gridded at 1° horizontal resolution. MOPITT has the greatest sensitivity to CO located in the midtroposphere, with little sensitivity to near‐surface CO [ ]. Prior versions of MOPITT data contained significant high biases in column CO when compared with estimates based on in situ observations as documented by . The version 4 products presented here contain significantly less bias. Compared to in situ profiles, estimated biases less than 1% at the surface, 700 hPa, and 100 hPa with a larger bias of −6% at 400 hPa. Additionally, MOPITT data are subject to a bias drift of 2 ppbv per year at 400 hPa and 1 ppb per year at 700 hPa. The column bias drift was 2 × 10 16 molecules cm −2 per year with an estimated uncertainty of 5 × 10 15 molecules cm −2 [ ]. In order to ensure that the GEOS‐5 column CO is comparable to MOPITT, GEOS‐5 column CO is calculated by regridding model output to the 1° horizontal resolution of the MOPITT product and applying the MOPITT averaging kernels as described by . In April, the peak biomass burning season in southeast Asia, GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate column CO relative to MOPITT. The degree of underestimation is greatest in the Northern Hemisphere; GEOS‐5 simulations underestimate MOPITT observations by as much as 20% in some areas, although underestimates less than 10% are more common. In the Southern Hemisphere, GEOS‐5 generally compares well with MOPITT, although column CO is overestimated over equatorial South America by 10–20%. GEOS‐5 is able to capture the major feature in the CO distribution during April which is a strong peak in burning over southeast Asia that is transported over long distances across the Pacific by easterly winds. However, the model produces less CO over both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans which may indicate either weaker long‐range pollution transport than observed or errors in CO lifetime due to uncertainty in the prescribed OH fields. In October, a time of increased biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere, GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate CO in the Southern Hemisphere. Observed and simulated distributions of CO are dominated by biomass burning activity evident over South America and Indonesia and the transport of biomass burning CO over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The model tends to underestimate column CO over portions of sub‐Saharan Africa by 10–30% while in the south Pacific and Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes and high latitudes, underestimations are typically 10–20%. GEOS‐5 tends to overestimate the CO peak due to biomass burning in South America and Indonesia by as much as 50% in some areas. Globally, GEOS‐5 underestimates column CO as measured by MOPITT by 3.8% in April while differences in October are 4.4%. The similarity of GEOS‐5 results with MOPITT observations demonstrates that GEOS‐5 is able to produce reasonable CO distributions. Differences between simulated and observed CO mixing ratios are likely related to uncertainties in CO emissions and global OH distributions as well as differences in simulated and observed atmospheric transport. Ensemble Formulation The basis of this study is an eight‐member ensemble of simulations that was produced using a range of settings for various parameters that control deep convection in GEOS‐5. These parameter settings are based on the work of , who evaluated profiles of convective mass flux and trace gases produced by CRMs and a column version of GEOS‐5. identified the parameters in the moist physics part of GEOS‐5 whose values exert the greatest control over convective mass flux. Using a simple set of perturbations in the SCM, identified 16 parameters in the moist physics as exerting a 1% or greater change in the time averaged vertically integrated convective mass flux. These 16 parameters were included in the more rigorous and computationally intensive screening known as regional sensitivity analysis (RSA), introduced by and extended to include multiple criteria by . The technique allows identification of “sensitive” parameters, whose settings can significantly impact the evolution of the simulations. conducted a large number of “Monte Carlo” type SCM simulations of three storms assuming different parameter values and used the time‐averaged vertically integrated convective mass flux derived from CRM simulations as a criterion to identify parameter sets which produced the most favorable results. In this manner, identified five of the 16 parameters as strongly influencing convective mass flux. The five parameters identified as sensitive were RASAL1 and RASAL2 (used to determine the strength and vertical profile of the relaxation time scale for deep convection), ACRITFAC (a factor used to compute the critical value of the cloud work function which determines the initiation of convection), BASE_EVAP_FAC (used to determine the amount of rain evaporated into the environment below the cloud base), and AUTOC_CN (used in the calculation of the autoconversion of convective condensate). These five parameters were varied to construct the eight‐member ensemble of GEOS‐5 AGCM simulations used in this work ( ). The ensemble consists of one simulation assuming default parameter settings (shown in ); five simulations using these parameter settings, except with alterations to a single parameter; and two simulations in which all five of the sensitive parameters are varied to create the strongest (MaxConv) or weakest (MinConv) representations of convection considered reasonable. In addition to ensuring that a wide range of uncertainty is represented, the strong and weak convection allow added insight into how the simulated atmosphere responds when the magnitude of convective mass flux is substantially altered. An important component of these simulations is that all ensemble members produce representations of convection that are reasonable, within the bounds of our knowledge. To ensure that the modified parameter settings produce reasonable precipitation patterns, we used gridded data sets from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) that were compiled from satellite and rain gauge observations and compared with precipitation estimates produced by the eight ensemble members. After interpolating monthly mean precipitation rates from the ensemble to the 2.5° GPCP grid, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for all ensemble members and are shown in . The annual mean correlation coefficients between the various simulations and the GPCP data ranged from the highest values of 0.65, in both the control and MaxConv simulations, to as low as 0.58 in the MinConv simulation. computed correlation coefficients between the GPCP data set and nine simulations that used different convective schemes in a single GCM. In their study, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.57 to 0.72 depending on the convective scheme employed. As in the simulations presented here, the simulations used observed SSTs (without assimilating meteorological information). Because the range of correlation coefficients for the simulations presented are similar to those computed by , the ensemble at the center of this work is likely comparable in variability and realism to other studies of convective parameterization uncertainty. Results Ensemble Variability Because the simulations presented here are free‐running, small changes such as parameter setting can lead to different realizations of the atmosphere including divergent locations of fronts and weather systems; to minimize such affects and differentiate the impacts of the parameters from internal model variability, we primarily present comparisons of multiannual monthly or seasonal averages in which monthly output from each ensemble member is averaged over several years before calculating ensemble statistics such as means and spreads. shows the ensemble mean and spread of column CO in MAM and SON based on 2 year (2000–2001) seasonal averages. Perturbations to parameters in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes exert the greatest influence on column CO abundance near CO source regions and in nearby outflow pathways. In MAM, the largest impacts of changes to the model's representation of convection are found in southeast Asia over the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. During SON, ensemble spread is largest over Indonesia, where strong burning occurs, especially during El Nino years. Elevated variability is also found over South America to the south and west of the region of peak column CO associated with biomass burning. In regions farther removed from CO sources, changes to moist physics parameters typically play a relatively small role in determining CO distributions. Ensemble spreads between 3 and 6% can be found in outflow pathways transporting Asian and African biomass burning pollution in April. During October, areas where ensemble spread is greater than 3% extend over portions of the Southern Hemisphere oceans demonstrating that the model's representation of convection can alter transport of CO to midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. In order to compare how variability introduced by changes in the model representation of convection differs from other types of variability, a second ensemble of eight simulations was created by initializing simulations with meteorological fields representing different days in January 2000 following . These model runs were integrated for 2 years and multiannual seasonal averages computed. The fundamental difference between the two ensembles is that in the meteorological ensemble, different realizations are produced by altering only the beginning state of the integration while physical processes are treated identically in all simulations; in the convective ensemble, all members start from identical initial conditions, but important aspects of the moist physics code have been altered. A comparison of the means and spreads of the two ensembles can be used to assess seasonal variability due to the changes in the moist physics and seasonal variability due to solely internal model variability; it should be noted that because changes in model physics parameters trigger different realizations of simulated meteorology, it is not possible to entirely separate the two influences. Ensemble spreads for MAM and SON are shown in . In order to separate differences between the convective and meteorological ensembles caused by alterations to convective parameters from internal model variability, we use the Fisher test ( F test) for statistically significant difference in variance. Globally, the ensemble produced by altering convection produces slightly larger variability than does the ensemble representing internal model variability though in both cases, ensemble spreads are small. In source and outflow regions, these differences are greater. Areas in which the influence of convective parameters differs from internal model variability tend to occur in regions where strong convection coincides with CO sources (i.e., biomass burning regions in Africa, South America, and Indonesia). Over midlatitude source regions such as China or the east coast of the United States, convective ensemble spreads are small and similar to background values found in remote regions. In different layers of the atmosphere, the patterns of variability introduced into CO mixing ratios by changes in convective parameters can vary substantially. At the surface in MAM ( ), ensemble spreads exceed 20% throughout the Bay of Bengal indicating that alterations to the model representation of convection can influence the transport of southeast Asian biomass burning pollution. Transport by low‐level westerlies near the equator is also affected. In the midtroposphere and upper troposphere during April, the greatest variability in CO mixing ratios lies in southeast Asia and the trans‐Pacific transport pathways of CO. The transport of CO to Northern Hemisphere high‐latitude locations near the tropopause is strongly influenced by convection parameters. CO concentrations in the polar lower stratosphere also appear to be strongly influenced by changes in the representation of convection although mixing ratios in this region are likely to be sensitive to a number of factors (including tropopause pressure and the timing and characteristics of stratospheric vortex breakdown) which may differ between ensemble members. The convective ensemble contains a larger degree of variability than the meteorological ensemble in stratospheric air masses (latitudes north of the tropopause line in ). In SON ( ), differences among ensemble members are generally smaller than in MAM. The largest variability in CO mixing ratios at the surface is not found near the peak in biomass burning activity in South America. Instead, a large degree of variability is found near Indonesia. At 300 and 500 hPa, stronger variability is found over areas of South America and the Pacific Ocean near strong biomass burning activity. We also examine the impact of changes in moist physics parameters on CO mixing ratios at a number of remote surface sites maintained by NOAA's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) observational network ( ). Data are collected weekly and are presented here for a subset of stations. GEOS‐5 model output is sampled on the same dates that observations were taken and is then interpolated to station locations and averaged monthly to produce an equivalent quantity. Using these monthly means, ensemble spreads are calculated at each station. It should be noted that the convective ensemble spread contains both the influence of changes in the model's moist physics and internal model variability. Simulated surface CO is assumed to be the mixing ratio in the lowest model layer. Simulations begin in January, 2000, but ensemble means and spreads are not calculated until March to allow time for differences in convection to alter CO distributions. GEOS‐5 is able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of CO at the GMD stations reasonably well ( ). At Northern Hemisphere midlatitude and high‐latitude stations represented here by Alert, Canada (ALT), Storhofdi, Iceland (ICE), and Shemya, Alaska (SHM), GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate CO relative to the surface observations in spring, which is consistent with the comparison with MOPITT observations shown in . At tropical and subtropical locations such as Assekrem, Algeria (ASK), Mariana Islands, Guam (GMI), Mahe Island, Seychelles (SEY) and Ascension Island (ASC, located between Africa and South America), GEOS‐5 is able to reasonably reproduce observed CO mixing ratios throughout the year though in some locations, peak CO mixing ratios associated with seasonal biomass burning are underestimated. Perturbations to parameters in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes tend to have a small impact at the remote surface sites sampled. Of all the GMD surface sites monitoring CO, changes to moist physics parameters most strongly affect the Tae‐ahn Peninsula (TAP) station located in Korea and strongly influenced by Asian biomass burning and anthropogenic CO. From 2000 to 2003, the average ensemble spread in monthly CO was 7% of the mean value with peak spreads exceeding 25%. CO mixing ratios are also strongly affected by the representation of convection at the ASC and SEY stations (5% spread from 2000 to 2003). In contrast to TAP, ensemble spreads at ASC and SEY are largest during biomass burning episodes and relatively small during other months. Averaged over all GMD sites in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and high latitudes, the annual mean ensemble spread in surface CO mixing ratio is 4%; at locations in the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres, variablity is 3% on average while at stations in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and high latitude, variations average only 1% annually. Simulations With Strong and Weak Convective Mass Fluxes In addition to analyzing results from the eight‐member ensemble, we also present a more detailed comparison of the MinConv and MaxConv simulations which produce representations of convective mass flux that are as weak and as strong as is considered reasonable based on the SCM analysis presented by . To highlight differences in vertical transport between the two simulations, we show results from the 4 year averages of July. To place the results of the MaxConv and MinConv simulations in the context of the ensemble, differences between the two simulations are compared to the ensemble spread; differences in multiannual averages greater than the spread are unlikely to be due to internal model variability alone. shows mean convective and grid‐scale vertical mass fluxes calculated during July for the MinConv and MaxConv simulations in the Northern Hemisphere tropics (0° to 15°N). Profiles are calculated from 4 year (2000–2003) multiannual monthly mean quantities which include both convective and nonconvective periods. Large‐scale mass fluxes are averaged separately for positive and negative values. The MaxConv simulation shows a large amount of shallow convective transport occurring below 5 km with less convective mass flux evident at upper levels. In the MinConv simulation, alterations to parameters in the model's moist physics schemes drastically reduce convective transport below 5 km. However, the grid‐scale upward mass flux increases at low levels. Downward grid‐scale mass flux also increased, but by a smaller amount. Above 10 km, grid‐scale upward mass fluxes are larger in the MaxConv simulation than the MinConv simulation which may indicate that stronger convection at low levels facilitates deeper mixing in the upper troposphere. Changes in the strength of parameterized convection also alter horizontal transport in the model. In the MinConv simulation, convergence below 3 km is slightly stronger in the Northern Hemisphere tropics than in the MaxConv simulation ( ). Between 3 and 12.5 km, divergence increases when convection is weaker. These results indicate that weaker parameterized convection may increase the magnitude of grid‐scale horizontal transport at low levels and midlevels. However, between 12.5 and 16.5 km, more divergence occurs in the MaxConv simulation. Grid‐scale upward mass flux at these levels is 20–30% stronger in the MaxConv simulation. These differences may be due in part to differences in tropopause height which is slightly higher in this region in the MaxConv simulation than in the MinConv simulation. Despite considerable changes in convective and grid‐scale mass fluxes, mean CO profiles calculated from both simulations over the same region are largely similar. Between 0° and 15°N during July, zonal mean CO profiles tend to reflect clean air over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans with small contributions from biomass burning over Indonesia and equatorial Africa and South America. In the MaxConv simulation, CO mixing ratios are larger between 2 and 10 km due to stronger convective mixing. Above 15 km, CO mixing ratios are larger in the MaxConv simulation due to a slightly elevated tropopause height. However, at all levels, differences are relatively small (less than 10 ppbv). demonstrated that the largest changes in mass flux between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations occurred below 5 km. In , differences in mass flux between the two simulations in the 2 to 5 km layer are presented in more detail. As is evident in , the changes to parameters in the model's moist physics schemes result in large decreases in convective mass flux in the MinConv simulation. The resulting increases in large‐scale upward grid‐scale mass flux tend to occur in regions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where convective mass fluxes have been diminished. The results suggest that when the magnitude of convection in the tropics is reduced, large‐scale upward motion in the model compensates to some extent. While showed that area mean changes in grid‐scale upward mass flux can be significant (∼50%), shows that in individual grid cells, such increases can be much larger. In some locations in the tropics, total upward mass flux (convective plus grid scale) can be comparable in magnitude in both simulations. However, areas of strong upward motion are more localized in the MinConv simulation than in the MaxConv simulation. In areas outside of the tropics where convection has weakened significantly in the MinConv run (i.e., North America, regions of Europe and Asia), little increase in upward grid‐scale mass flux is found. Changes in parameter values that influence the intensity of convective mass fluxes affect the model's representation of turbulence as well as the large‐scale circulation. shows the mean value of scalar diffusivity during July calculated between 0 and 2 km above the surface in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations. When convection is significantly weakened (as in the MinConv simulation), diffusivity is strongly increased in many regions, particularly over oceans. It should be noted that these differences are smaller than the eight‐member ensemble spread in most regions indicating that they may not be significant. In order to study the collective impact of differences in vertical transport processes in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations, we consider the hypothetical time it would take an air parcel to traverse several atmospheric layers. Hypothetical model transport times were calculated by first estimating a single vertical velocity that includes grid‐scale vertical motion, convective motion (calculated by dividing convective mass flux by air density), and turbulent diffusion (estimated using scalar diffusivity and model layer thickness) for all model layers using monthly mean output; the time required for a parcel to pass upward through each layer was calculated using this velocity and the layer thickness. It should be noted that parameterized processes transport gases instantaneously during a model time step. The hypothetical model transport times are presented as a diagnostic tool to aid in interpretation of the simulations presented in this section and may not accurately represent the time scales of physical transport in the real atmosphere. shows the hypothetical time that would be required for an air parcel to pass from the bottom of the layer to the top for layers from 0 to 2 km, 2 to 5 km, 5 to 8 km, and 8 to 10 km in the MaxConv and MinConv simulations during July (based on 4 year multiannual means). Despite large differences in convective mass fluxes, grid‐scale vertical motion, and turbulent diffusion, the hypothetical model transport times are similar between the two simulations. Below 2 km, the MinConv simulation tends to indicate more rapid ascent in some areas due to stronger turbulence. Between 2 and 5 km, peak transport times (occurring in the ITCZ) are similar between the two simulations though the MaxConv simulation features broader areas of ascent as indicated in . Monthly mean transport times between 5 and 10 km are also similar in the two simulations. shows probability distribution functions (pdfs) computed for the same four atmospheric layers shown in (0–2 km, 2–5 km, 5–8 km, and 8–10 km). Pdfs are computed over all Northern Hemisphere grid boxes. Differences between the MaxConv and MinConv simulation tend to be small near the surface though the MinConv simulation displays slightly shorter residence times due to the increase in diffusivity shown in . In both the 2 to 5 and 5 to 8 km layers, the MaxConv simulation shows a larger proportion of grid cells with residence times less than 3 days than does the MinConv simulation indicating that the stronger convection is more efficient at transporting CO upward through these layers. Between 8 and 10 km, the distribution of transport times is similar between the two simulations though the MaxConv simulations show a slightly larger percentage of grid cells with residence times less than 4 days. Differences in both convective and grid‐scale mass flux between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations result in different ways of transporting CO from source regions. In order to better understand these differences, we examine CO fluxes out of the Indonesian region in 2002. Biomass burning in the region was the strongest during SON. shows the mass of CO during this period integrated from 5°S to the equator and 108°E to 118°E below 1 km. On average during the period presented, the difference in CO mass in the region between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations is only 2%. Additionally, the mass of CO in both simulations displays approximately the same cycle; the reduction in convective mass flux in the MinConv simulation does not result in CO mass remaining at low levels over Indonesia for extended periods of time. The convective, net vertical and net horizontal mass fluxes out of the 1 km vertical “box” region focused over Indonesia are also shown in . As expected, convective transport of CO out of this volume is significantly larger in the MaxConv simulation relative to the MinConv simulation. Net grid‐scale vertical mass fluxes of CO are larger in the MinConv simulation than in the MaxConv simulation throughout the burning period. In addition to increased vertical advective transport of CO, horizontal CO advection out of the Indonesian region is also larger in the MinConv simulation. Two factors may be contributing to changes in advective CO fluxes when convection is weakened. One factor is that when convective transport is weakened, less CO is transported by convection meaning that more CO is available to be transported by either vertical or horizontal winds. The second factor is that when convection is weakened in the model, vertical and horizontal winds are altered (as shown in – ). In order to understand which factor is dominant, we show the percentage of change in vertical and horizontal mass flux when convection is reduced for both CO and air mass flux in . Changes in CO mass flux tend to closely follow changes in air mass flux for both vertical and horizontal transport. When convective mass fluxes are reduced in the MinConv simulation, the grid‐scale vertical mass flux of CO increases by 90% on average during the period; at times, increases can be as large as a factor of four. Vertical air mass flux increases by an average 70% indicating that the majority of the change in vertical CO mass flux is due to changes in the magnitude of vertical winds. Horizontal CO mass flux increases by 40% on average while horizontal air mass flux increases by 27%. Though changes in horizontal winds are smaller than changes in vertical winds, because they are considerably stronger, these changes strongly affect CO distributions and the transport of CO from source regions. Though convective parameter settings strongly reduce convective mass flux, particularly at low levels, they do not impose as strong an influence on total mass flux. In the MinConv simulation, compensating increases in turbulent and upward grid‐scale transport result in transport times comparable in magnitude at many locations to those derived from the MaxConv simulation. As a result, CO distributions in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations are largely similar. shows the zonal mean distribution of CO during April in both simulations (based on 4 year multiannual averages) as well as the difference between the two simulations. Throughout the atmosphere, the CO distributions produced by the MinConv and MaxConv simulations tend to be similar though differences are evident in some locations. The MaxConv simulation produces larger CO mixing ratios in the Northern Hemisphere tropics in the lower troposphere; these differences slant northward with altitude and peak near the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics. shows zonal mean CO distributions calculated in October. As in April, zonal mean CO distributions produced by the MinConv and MaxConv simulations are similar. A similar feature of enhanced CO in the MaxConv simulation is found in the Northern Hemisphere tropics and subtropics though the peak differences are smaller than in April. Mixing ratios also tend to be larger in the MaxConv simulation in the vicinity of the tropopause and in the lower stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. shows column CO amounts calculated from the MinConv and MaxConv simulations. Column CO is calculated by applying the MOPITT averaging kernels to facilitate comparison with observations shown in . The global distributions of column CO are similar between the two simulations (the global mean for both simulations is 1.5 × 10 18 molecules cm −2 in October and April), though locally differences can be significant. In both April and October, the MaxConv simulation produces more CO over equatorial regions than does the MinConv simulation. This is likely because MOPITT's strongest sensitivity lies in the midtroposphere and the MaxConv simulations more vigorously transports CO from biomass burning source regions to these levels. In April, the MaxConv simulation tends to perform better than the MinConv simulation in the tropics with a lesser degree of underestimation relative to MOPITT. Because the differences in column CO are relatively small between the simulations, it is not possible to identify a single convection scheme tuning as optimal. Summary and Conclusions demonstrated the importance of parameter settings in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes in determining convective mass flux and trace gas profiles produced by a single‐column version of the model. Here, we evaluate the impact of changes to these parameters on global CO distributions using 3D GEOS‐5 simulations. The upward transport of CO is influenced not only by the magnitude of mass flux, but also its spatial correlation with CO emissions and their vertical gradients. Because the majority of CO is emitted at the surface and CO is relatively short lived, CO distributions tend to decrease significantly above the boundary layer in source regions. It is this gradient, coupled with alterations in mass flux, that may be expected to alter CO distributions when convective parameters are changed. If, instead of surface sources, CO distributions were dominated by a near constant source throughout the troposphere, changes in updraft mass flux would likely have little impact. An ensemble of eight simulations was constructed by altering values of parameters which found to strongly influence convective mass flux. Analysis of the ensemble results indicates regions where simulated CO distributions are sensitive to alterations in the model representation of convection and where uncertainty introduced into CO distributions by uncertainty in parameterized convection should be considered the greatest. The ensemble spread in column CO amount is typically small though areas near CO source regions and in outflow pathways often display variability greater than in remote regions. Globally, the variability in column CO distributions introduced by alterations to moist physics parameters is less than 3% at most locations. Comparison with an ensemble of simulations produced by initializing simulations with different meteorological fields indicates that over much of the world, altered convective parameters produce variations in CO only slightly larger than those produced by internal model variability. Statistically significant differences in spread between the two ensembles are most likely to occur in tropical outflow pathways where convection is active and large amounts of CO are present. At individual levels, variability in CO mixing ratios introduced by changes in convective parameters can be significantly larger than variability in column CO and the distribution of variability can vary significantly with altitude. The results indicate the importance of interactions between convective detrainment levels and horizontal winds, which can vary strongly with altitude, in determining trace gas distributions. Global plots of the ensemble spread of CO distributions demonstrate that changes in convective parameters have a relatively small influence at remote surface locations such as the sites maintained by NOAA's GMD. The annual mean ensemble spread in surface CO mixing ratio was 4% at Northern Hemisphere midlatitude and high‐latitude sites, 3% at subtropical and tropical sites in both hemispheres, and only 1% at midlatitude and high‐latitude locations in the Southern Hemisphere. These results indicate that inversion studies using remote surface site data are likely relatively insensitive to uncertainty in simulated representations of convection. At some locations, however, variations in CO introduced by changes in the model's moist physics parameters can be significant. At the Tae‐ahn Peninsula, large ensemble spread throughout the year indicates that variations in convection can affect the transport of anthropogenic and biomass burning pollution from Asia. At stations in the Seychelles and Ascension Island, variations associated with convection show a much stronger seasonal dependence associated with annual cycles of biomass burning. In order to gain further insight into the changes in CO mixing ratios introduced by changes in convection, we examined the MaxConv and MinConv simulations in greater detail. Changes in the model's moist physics parameters strongly influence convective mass flux, but also alter grid‐scale vertical and turbulent transport processes. When convective mass flux is reduced in the tropics by altering parameter settings, grid‐scale upward mass flux tends to increase, particularly at low levels. Increases in upward grid‐scale mass flux in the MinConv simulation tend to be focused in regions of the tropics and ITCZ which experience strong convection in the MaxConv simulation. Turbulent diffusion in the boundary layer also strongly increases when convective mass flux is reduced. Though convective mass fluxes are greatly reduced in the MinConv simulation, compensating increases in turbulent and advective transport largely compensate for these decreases, resulting in comparable estimated atmospheric transport times at many locations. As a result, zonal mean CO distributions are remarkably similar between the simulations despite large differences in the roles of various transport processes. Changes in convective and advective transport resulting from parameter changes also influence the transport biomass burning emissions out of the Indonesian region. Though convection is strongly reduced in the MinConv simulation relative to the MaxConv simulation, the mass of CO below 1 km over Indonesia is similar in both simulations. Decreases in convective transport of CO are balanced by increases in vertical and horizontal flux of CO out of the source region. An analysis of CO and air mass flux differences indicate that CO flux changes resulting from weaker convection largely follow changes in air mass fluxes. The results indicate that the dynamical interaction of convection with the grid‐scale vertical and horizontal winds plays a primary role in altering vertical and horizontal CO advection while the increased availability of CO to other transport pathways is secondary in importance. Though the results of this analysis indicate that changes in simulated convection induced by alterations to convective parameters play a relatively small role in determining global CO distributions, it should be noted that this is due in large part to the complex interactions between parameterized convection and other transport processes. Evaluation of the MinConv and MaxConv simulations demonstrate that when transport by parameterized convection is drastically reduced, model dynamics compensate by increasing grid‐scale mass fluxes and boundary layer turbulence. The result is that both simulations produce a realistic climate and largely similar trace gas distributions though the model calculates these answers in very different ways. noted that offline chemical transport model studies which attempt to identify the role of convection in determining trace gas distributions are hindered by the split operator design of most GCMs in which convection is treated both as a sub‐grid‐scale parameterized process and is also partially resolved in large‐scale circulation features such as the Hadley and Walker Cells. In this study, we demonstrate that online GCM studies are also affected. When convective activity produced by the convective parameterization is sharply reduced (as in the MinConv simulation), the large‐scale circulation compensates by increasing activity similar to convection in many of the same regions. Our results support the conclusion of that convective activity cannot be solely attributed to the convective parameterization in a GCM. A number of studies have compared convective mass fluxes produced by different atmospheric models. We have shown that simulations with drastically different convective mass flux profiles can produce similar hypothetical layer residence times and CO distributions. The results presented here suggest that it is important to consider convective mass flux comparisons in the context of total mass flux (including contributions from large‐scale and turbulent transport processes) in attempting to understand intermodel differences in transport. In order to better understand the role of convection in determining trace gas distributions, it may be necessary to categorize processes using model and parameterization independent metrics such as transport time scale or the presence of moisture. In addition, though CO is a useful tracer of convection, our simulations indicate that analysis of CO alone is not always adequate to separate the impacts of different transport processes using these methods. Preliminary studies with radon and carbon dioxide, which are considerably short lived and longer lived, respectively, indicate that the impact of convective parameter changes depends strongly on a number of factors including the lifetime of a trace gas and the seasonal covariation of its sources with physical processes like convection. Shorter‐lived gases are likely to show larger ensemble spreads with less statistical significance (i.e., a stronger influence of internal model variability) while longer‐lived gases show weaker responses to convective changes but greater ability to separate these changes from internal model variability. Future studies which consider multiple trace gases with differing atmospheric lifetimes and varying solubility may help to reduce uncertainty in the role that different transport processes play. The current and next generation of GCMs and chemistry‐climate models which include online transport of chemical species provide an ideal foundation for such studies because they allow full interaction between physical and chemical processes.

Deserts in Gobi and Taklamakan in Mongolia and in northwestern China across East Asia have expanded substantially over the past several decades [ ; ; ]. The socioeconomic and health impacts of the desertification, and consequent transboundary transports of enormous yellow sands originating from those regions are serious concerns not only for China and the adjacent countries in East Asia but also for the western U.S. [ ; ], so that desertification mitigation has been a vital environmental issue across these regions. In order to mitigate the desertification, many efforts have been made such as tree planting, windbreak building, petroleum spraying, and artificial precipitation formation. These methods are likely to have various effects on the local surface and soil characteristics and microclimate through physical changes (e.g., decreased wind speeds, soil erosion, and runoff) and/or thermodynamic changes (e.g., changes in surface energy and water balance). However, it remains equivocal that these efforts have substantial effects on desertification mitigation, inducing satisfactory consequences via the change of land‐atmosphere coupling (e.g., feedback between precipitation and soil moisture or surface temperature) that is a major cause of droughts and desertification in subtropics and midlatitudes. Unfortunately, such a land‐atmosphere coupling cannot readily be changed by land surface changes if the feedback is dominated by dynamic circulations. Therefore, one should pay more attention to a longer‐standing solution, i.e., the changes in hydrological coupling strength between the atmosphere and the land surface changes. The strong land‐atmosphere coupling implies strong dependency of local climates on lands and high vulnerability of the drylands to warm season (April–September) droughts [ , ; ]. This is because the coupling over the drylands is primarily driven by a positive feedback between precipitation and soil moisture (i.e., precipitation deficit and dry soil) and because initial abrupt precipitation deficits are more likely to develop into droughts through this feedback. It has been found that, while warm season droughts tend to be initiated by a precipitation deficit caused by anomalous large‐scale circulations, they are maintained through the positive feedback between the soil moisture and the precipitation over the central U.S. [ ; ; ; ]. This mechanism may also be favorable in the drylands over Mongolia and northern China, with strong hydrological coupling between local precipitation and soil moisture [ ; ; ]. Over these regions, over 60% of the annual precipitation is concentrated on summer [ ]. Thus, rainfall suppression during the warm seasons could easily develop into serious long‐term droughts. For this reason, the coupling strength and its change are particularly sensitive to vulnerability to droughts and, consequently, desertification. Vegetation can modify the coupling strength mainly by changing its evapotranspiration rate, surface energy flux, surface albedo and surface roughness length [ ; ; ; , ]. For example, use of the Community Land Model (CLM) revealed that an increased rate of rain dropping from leaves to the ground was found to enhance the coupling strength over the U.S. [ ]. However, dozens of parameters are associated with vegetation in the CLM, and the vegetation effect on the coupling strength is largely dependent on regional characteristics of soil, vegetation type, local climate, and topography. Accordingly, the integrated impact of vegetation on coupling strength in drylands is worth investigation. Although the coupling strength in East Asian drylands has not yet been investigated, several studies found the climatic impact of vegetation worldwide in various aspects: contributions of forests in the midlatitude to global circulations [e.g., ; ; ], contributions of vegetation to monsoonal circulations in southeastern Asia [e.g., ; ; ], the impacts of afforestation in the Sahel and Amazon regions of the tropics in terms of the changes in surface energy balance, ground and undergroundwater flow, atmospheric water and precipitation, and surface temperature [ ; ; ]. We note that the impacts of deforestation on climate and water supplies have been also studied extensively [ ; ; ], but the hydrological and thermodynamic influences of deforestation may not be the exact opposite to those of afforestation. The vegetation effect on modulating the coupling strength has implication of afforestation policy to mitigate desertification. To use a metaphor, this effect of afforestation may be compared with oriental herb treatment that aims to cure the root causes of disease and improve the physical constitution of the human body rather than focus on removing disease symptoms. Additionally, if the modulation of the coupling strength occurs not remotely but locally, identifying a region with maximal vegetation‐induced changes in coupling strength will be of great use to policy makers because they can determine the most effective tree planting regions. This is indeed important for those with limited economic and human resources. In this regard, this concentrated tree planting is what we refer to as “acupuncture‐like afforestation.” Based on the aforementioned rationale, we first investigates the impact of vegetation on the land‐atmosphere coupling over the entire study region in East Asia. Then we will suggest the tree planting with due consideration of the land‐atmosphere coupling for desertification mitigation within the study region. Experiment Design and Computation of Coupling Strength This study is based on the coupled model simulation: the regional climate model (Weather Research Forecasting model 3.0; WRF) coupled with the land surface model (CLM model 3.5) from University of California at Berkeley is employed with 6 h NCEP final analysis (FNL) data for initial and boundary conditions. In this model, the land soil is represented by 17 soil texture types, which determine the thermal and hydrologic soil properties. The terrestrial vegetation is described by 16 Plantation Functional Types (PFTs). The land use data set of USGS provided by the WRF preprocessing system was used, which allowed for 24 land use categories that are determined by the combination of bare ground and several PFT types. Vegetation phenology is provided from the vegetation fraction of the monthly averaged USGS data. The PFTs characterize properties including solar radiation, soil root distribution, aerodynamics at the vegetation‐atmosphere interface, and photosynthesis rates [ ]. The spatial distributions of the most and second dominant PFTs within the domain of the study are shown in and , respectively, with the summer (June, July, and August, or JJA) mean vegetation fraction shown in . also displays four subregions of interest: the eastern edges of the Gobi desert in the north central domain (NC), the Manchurian Plains in northeastern China (NE), the urban areas (Beijing and Tianjin) of central China (UC), and the crop regions of south central China (SC). The region, SC, is included due to substantial changes in coupling strength as shown later in this manuscript, though having a subtropical climate. A short summary on the local climate and major vegetation types in each selected region is listed in . The model domain has 141 × 141 grid points with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 km. The physical parameterization schemes used in this study are the Kain‐Fritsch convective parameterization scheme, WSM3 cloud microphysics scheme, RRTM long‐wave radiation scheme, MM5 long‐wave radiation scheme, and YSU planetary boundary layer scheme. This study employs two different experiments: CLM default prescribed vegetation (VEG experiment) and bare ground (NOVEG experiment). While, in the VEG experiment, each grid is assigned by both bare ground and several PFTs up to four, all the PFTs in a grid was set to zero (i.e., bare ground) in the NOVEG experiment. Once calculations are performed at the PFT level in the CLM, fluxes of energy, water, and momentum are aggregated at the grid cell level and passed to the WRF. The WRF provides atmospheric components such as wind, temperature, humidity, pressure, and number of radiations at the lowest level to the CLM. The CLM then calculates surface energy, albedo, momentum, and radiation fluxes and updates the soil hydrologic states based on these fluxes, which are then passed back to the WRF. The simulation period was from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Output data from 1 January to 30 November 2000 are discarded as a spin‐up period; in the rest, 4 year outputs were used for the analysis. To investigate the effects of vegetation on hydrological land‐atmospheric coupling, this study focuses on monthly anomalies of precipitation ( P ′) and evapotranspiration ( E ′) and coupling strength (CS). Based on the study of , the hydrological CS is calculated using the equation as follows: _placeholder_formula_ Here, i is the number of months; P ′ is the 30 day anomaly of precipitation (mm/d) with a 5 day moving interval; and E ′ is the 30 day anomaly of evapotranspiration (mm/d) with a 5 day moving interval. The anomalies P ′ and E ′ are computed based on 4 year averages of monthly (i.e., 30 day) precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. The total number of months ( N ) is 52 (13 cases × 4 years) (e.g., 1–30 June, 5 June to 4 July, 10 June to 9 July, 1–30 August). The CS estimates the fractional contribution of the covariance between precipitation and evapotranspiration deviations to variance of the precipitation deviations. The greater contribution of E ′ to P ′, and vice versa, for the same variance of P ′ leads to a higher CS. The analysis was performed only for JJA and for regions with rainfall ≥1.5 mm/d in this study. This is because the impacts of vegetation are the most pronounced in the summer and because CS computation is meaningless over regions with extremely low rainfall rates, which is the case over the most northern domains in the other seasons. Results Impact of Vegetation on Mean and Variability of Hydrological Variables shows JJA mean precipitation ( _placeholder_formula_ ) and evapotranspiration ( _placeholder_formula_ ) of the VEG experiment for 2001–2004 and their differences (Δ) between the VEG and NOVEG experiments (Δ _placeholder_formula_ and Δ _placeholder_formula_ ). In general, the WRF‐CLM model simulates well 4 year summer climatology of P and E over most of East Asia ( and ), both in the magnitude and geographical distribution, compared with observations (not shown). For both _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ , strong gradients between the northwestern and southeastern regions are also found in observations. The model has a tendency to overestimate rainfall along the southern boundary of the domain ( ). Despite some heterogeneous spatial patterns, vegetation tends to increase both precipitation and evapotranspiration over the northwestern regions, but to decrease them over the southern regions ( and ), consequently diminishing the northwest‐southeast gradients. These differences between VEG and NOVEG are statistically significant over most of the model domain at a 95% confidence level. On the other hand, changes in _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ are expected to contribute to changes in soil moisture in a transition zone between dry and humid regions; namely, higher _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ is likely to induce wetter soil. displays _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ ( ) and soil moisture differences in the top 1.8 cm layer ( _placeholder_formula_ ) ( ). Comparison of with indicates that spatial patterns of the difference of _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ are not identical to those of _placeholder_formula_ , while extremely high _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ is responsible for the increase of _placeholder_formula_ in some regions (e.g., the eastern part of NE and the areas between UC and SC). This result suggests that soil moisture changes associated with changes in vegetation are only partly controlled by mean changes in _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ . The impact of vegetation is also present upon variability of P and E , which is illustrated in showing standard deviations of monthly P ′ and E ′ ( σ ( P ′), and σ ( E ′)) and their differences (Δ σ ( P ′), and Δ σ ( E ′)) between the VEG and NOVEG experiments. As to precipitation, σ ( P ′) is similar to _placeholder_formula_ in terms of a northwest‐southeast gradient ( and ). However, as to evapotranspiration, the similarity between σ ( E ′) and _placeholder_formula_ is unclear ( and ). Spatial patterns of Δ σ ( P ′) ( ) are rather distinct from those of Δ _placeholder_formula_ , especially over the Gobi desert in the northwestern regions of the domain ( ). Discrepancy in the vegetation‐induced differences between the mean and the variance of evapotranspiration ( and ) is noticeable mainly in the Gobi desert and the central China. The values Δ σ ( E ′) appear to be statistically significant over the four sub study regions at the 95% level ( ), while the values Δ σ ( P ′) are less significant ( ). These characteristics indicate that vegetation affects both mean and variability of precipitation and evapotranspiration, but with different sensitivity to regions. A significant amount of literature investigating the response of precipitation to the changes in vegetation discussed in the review paper of mostly tackled issues associated with the mean changes in precipitation. In this study, we focus on the variability rather than the mean of the hydrological variables because CS is dependent on their anomalies only, as defined in . Modulation of Vegetation on Coupling Strength The CS of the VEG and NOVEG experiments in JJA and the differences between the VEG and NOVEG experiments are displayed in . Although CS in is based on the model output of WRF‐CLM, the spatial pattern and magnitudes of CS are very similar to the coupling strength computed by ECMWF reanalysis in , Figure 1] despite both analyses in different time periods and different data resolutions. While CS is higher over the northern domain than the southern domain because of the limited availability of soil moisture ( ), VEG had a lower CS than did NOVEG in most of the domain ( ). Over the three selected areas (NE, UC, and SC) in particular, the reduction rate of CS by inclusion of vegetation ranged from 40% to 85% ( ). In contrast, a higher CS was identified over the eastern edges of the Gobi desert (NC) (18% increase; ). A student's t test for the difference of CSs computed for each summer of 2001–2004 (p value in ) indicates that the differences in the negative regions (NE, UC, and SC) are statistically significant at the 95% level. The opposite response of CS to vegetation is partially attributed to the characteristics of the present major vegetation types (i.e., crop and needleleaf evergreen temperate tree (NETT) in NE, UC, and SC versus grass in NC as shown in and and in ) since the combination of crop/grass as the first/second PFTs in and (e.g., the southwestern NE and UC neighborhoods and the south central SC) tends to hamper the reduction of CS compared to the combination of crop/NETT (e.g., the central NE and UC and the eastern SC). Moreover, replacing the grass with crops in NC in an additional experiment resulted in negative CS differences (not shown), which is opposite to the result in . Nevertheless, not every crop/NETT combination area shows significant decreases in CS, including the southern parts and the northeastern parts of SC, which implies the significance of other factors that are responsible for the differences in CS other than the dominant vegetation types (e.g., soil type, topography, land‐atmosphere interactions, and transport of air and moisture). The substantial reductions in CS by the inclusion of vegetation, such as in NE, UC, and SC, indicates that the vegetation contributes to desertification mitigation. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the changes in CS significantly affect regional hydrological characteristics and aridity. Studies on warm season droughts over the transition zones in the midlatitude suggest that, although long‐lasting serious droughts are initiated by abnormal large‐scale circulations, the significant roles of the land surface interactions with the atmosphere cannot be neglected since they maintain and amplify the initial droughts, which leads to long‐lasting droughts [ ]. Considering this mechanism of droughts, the presence of a CS reduction theoretically implies that those regions can be affected not only by less intense but also by less frequent summer droughts due to vegetation since the positive feedback between the atmosphere and the land surface is less likely to amplify an original precipitation deficit. This speculation is consistent with the changes of JJA mean soil moisture, _placeholder_formula_ ( ). Moisture in the soil of the top layer is highly variable and directly influences surface evapotranspiration and energy flux. It is a reliable proxy for drought indices such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) over snow‐free regions [ ] in that it reflects the aggregate effect of the hydrologic processes in the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere as well as their interactions at various time scales. shows that lower CS is coincident with wetter soil in NE, UC, and SC, and vice versa in NC. The difference of _placeholder_formula_ between VEG and NOVEG was statistically significant at the 95% level in the four sub study regions. The wetter soil in the VEG over NE, UC, and SC might result from increased JJA mean of precipitation minus evapotranspiration ( _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ ) as well, as discussed previously in the . However, the difference in _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was negative ( ), and the impact of vegetation on _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was inconsistent with that on _placeholder_formula_ over those study regions. The difference between _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was not fully explained by changes in runoff (not shown). These results are interesting because the difference (VEG minus NOVEG) of mean soil moisture appears to be linked with those of CS that is based on the anomalies of P and E. Thus, the opposite tendency of the differences in CS and soil moisture shown in alludes that CS reduction decreases local vulnerability to drought by changing the land‐atmosphere feedback characteristics and local climate, which ultimately tends to alleviate desertification in East Asia. Identification of the Most Effective Regions of Tree Planting While vegetation tends to modulate local coupling strength significantly, the impact of vegetation on the CS as shown in may be subject to vegetation fraction since the VEG experiment implemented the vegetation close to current status in CLM. In an attempt to remove this dependency, the difference of CS (VEG minus NOVEG) divided by the JJA mean vegetation fraction (shown in ) is calculated and shown in (normalized difference of CS; NDCS). Comparison of with demonstrates that while NDCS is slightly reduced over the densely distributed vegetation regions such as the northeastern and southwestern domains, a strong reduction of NDCS is still predominant over the regions where the difference in the nonnormalized CS ( ) is large. In particular, NDCS is significantly noticeable over the areas with vegetation fractions <50% (indicated by black contours in ). These areas include the eastern peripheries of Gobi desert, Manchurian Plains (NE), and fast urbanization areas in central China (UC). In particular, NE and UC are acknowledged as being the most hazardous regions in which the fast transition from greenness to aridness has occurred over the past several decades [ ]. suggests that tree planting over these regions would reduce CS more considerably than would planting over the other regions and mitigate desertification of East Asia in terms of atmosphere‐land coupling. For the identification and suggestion of the most effective regions for tree planting in to be valid, the impact of afforestation on CS should be a locally oriented process (i.e., changes in evapotranspiration) rather than a remotely oriented process (i.e., large‐scale circulation and associated moisture flux divergence). One way to test this hypothesis is to determine whether moisture transports from other regions play an important role in precipitation variability. If vegetation‐induced CS changes are mainly associated with great changes in moisture flux divergence ( MFD , hereafter) instead of evapotranspiration, the influence of afforestation on CS occurs remotely and then the local modulation of CS in one area becomes sensitive to the specific locations of the trees planted elsewhere. In this case, finding the most effective tree planting areas requires a complicated set of model experiments, and the result is less reliable. Neglecting surface runoff and drainage, P , E , and MFD are interrelated according to the approximation of the surface hydrologic balances on a monthly time scale ( MFD = P − E ) and; thus, monthly anomalous MFD ( MFD ′) was estimated from the monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration. displays the differences in the area‐averaged standard deviations of MFD ′ between VEG and NOVEG [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] in each selected region. Similarly, [Δ σ ( P ′)] and [Δ σ ( E ′)] for the anomalies of P and E , respectively. Although [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] is commensurate with that of [Δ σ ( E ′)] in magnitude over NC, indicates not only that the absolute magnitudes of [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] are much less than those of [Δ σ ( E ′)] but also that [Δ σ ( P ′)] are mainly related with [Δ σ ( E ′)] in sign over NE, UC, and SC. The former result implies the smaller magnitudes of MFD ′ compared to P ′ and E ′, because P ′, E ′, and MFD ′ are quantities of anomalies and their standard deviations are likely to be proportional to their absolute magnitudes. When the surface runoff and drainage are also taken into account, the MFD ′ magnitudes are expected to be even smaller than those shown in . Although this analysis does not completely eliminate the possibility of remote impact of afforestation on CS in other regions, the result in is indicative of the fact that vegetation controls the CS rather locally. In this respect, provides valuable information about the most effective regions of tree planting for desertification mitigation in terms of atmosphere‐land CS. Causes on the Changes in Coupling Strength According to , it is reasonable to assume that the differences of CS may be associated with changes of signs in P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i and/or absolute magnitude of CS . For the numerator (∑ i =1 N P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ), changes can be induced by either or both of the following: (1) changes in number of cases with opposite signs between P ′ and E ′, thus with a negative sign of P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i (decoupling frequency, hereafter), and (2) changes in the sign‐neglected magnitude of P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i (=∣ P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ∣). Change of decoupling frequency is higher in UC and SC (14.8% and 14.6%, respectively) than in NC and NE (−3.1%, and 8.7%, respectively), but it is less than 15%. On the other hand, the original CS and the sign‐neglected CS averaged over the selected regions for the VEG and NOVEG experiments are shown in . Differences in the original CS are the same values as shown in . For either VEG or NOVEG, the sign‐neglected CS was higher than the original CS, especially in UC and SC, but the VEG‐NOVEG differences did not change much between the original case and the sign‐neglected case; in fact, they remained almost the same in NE and NC and slightly increased in UC and SC. This result implies that the changes in the absolute magnitude of CS is more critical to the induction of significant CS changes between VEG and NOVEG than the changes in decoupling frequency. Changes in CS may be more sensitive to changes in the value of the denominator than those in the numerator. displays area‐averaged amounts of numerators (sign‐neglected value, ∑ i =1 N ∣ P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ∣) and denominators (∑ i =1 N P ′ i 2 ) and their differences (%) between VEG and NOVEG. In all of the selected regions, numerator changes were much greater than denominator changes, which consequently determine the signs of the CS differences. Furthermore, changes in the absolute magnitude of CS are attributed to larger changes in E ′ than in P ′. This feature is supported by , which shows the differences (in percent) of the area‐averaged standard deviations of P ′ and E ′ between VEG and NOVEG (Δ P ′ and Δ E ′) in each selected region. Here, Δ P ′ and Δ E ′ were computed as: _placeholder_formula_ Note that first, Δ P ′ and Δ E ′ are close estimates of the difference of absolute magnitudes of P ′ and E ′ between VEG and NOVEG. Second, the magnitude of P ′ tends to be inversely proportional to CS due to the cancellation effect of P ′ in the numerator by P ′ 2 in the denominator in , but the magnitude of E ′ is proportional to CS. According to , in NC, where ΔCS is positive in and , the positive changes of CS stems from the larger increase in E ′, while the increase in P ′ tends to decrease CS. Similarly, in the other three regions (NE, UC, and SC), where ΔCS is negative, the reduction of CS is mainly caused by larger decreases in E ′ despite the decrease in P ′. This analytical result is indicative of the significant modulation of vegetation on CS, primarily through modifying the evapotranspiration variability. This is confirmed by the variability changes of evapotranspiration in corresponding with the changes of CS in over most of the domain. Evapotranspiration in CLM is a complex function of several variables, such as surface wind speed, temperature, humidity, and aerodynamic leaf and surface resistance. Furthermore, on a daily or monthly time scale, complicated interactions arise between land surface variables in CLM and atmospheric variables in WRF by coupling the models with the land surface and by boundary layer processes as described in the . This is why CS responds differently over the same PFT regions as discussed in . Declines of the standard deviation of evapotranspiration anomalies signify that the vegetation helps keep the evapotranspiration constant. The soil moisture memory in the dry areas appears to be short because its water‐holding capacity is low due to its sparse vegetation; as such, it is probable that planting trees over these regions would affect evapotranspiration, runoff, and, ultimately, soil moisture [ ; ]. Indeed, supporting this speculation, the longer memory of the top 1.8 cm soil layer in the VEG compared to the NOVEG experiment was discovered over dry regions of East Asia in this study (not shown). As a result, combination of the results in and suggests that vegetation is likely to alter local evapotranspiration and precipitation variability and then change the atmosphere‐land CS in the dry lands of East Asia. Discussion and Conclusions This study investigated the impact of vegetation on the hydrological coupling between land and atmosphere, based on the simulations of the WRF‐CLM coupled model. We found that vegetation is predisposed to reduce the atmosphere‐land linkage and to increase soil moisture over the several dry and wet regions in East Asia. This potential impact of vegetation is worth taking into account, because various attempts to mitigate desertification have been made, with the fundamental concepts of drought and desertification (i.e., maintenance of droughts by strong feedbacks between the atmosphere and land) missing. This study reports for the first time, to our knowledge, the indirect but fundamental impact of vegetation on the CS between the atmosphere and the land surface. The most important hydrological factor in the CS change by vegetation appears to be evapotranspiration: vegetation tends to reduce the variability of evapotranspiration like a water reservoir in the soil and then diminish the CS. The vegetation‐induced CS declines result in enhanced JJA mean soil moisture ( ), suggesting decreases in drought intensity and/or occurrence. However, this effect is limited in some regions such as the northern central domain (NC). Although our VEG and NOVEG experiments are not ideal for directly describing afforestation effects, this result suggests that an afforestation effect may have a unique contribution to desertification mitigation. After testing the regional dependency of the impact of vegetation on CS, this study ultimately suggests several key regions including the Manchurian Plains (NE) and the rapid urbanization areas in central China (UC) as the most efficient areas for vegetation planting with respect to CS reduction. Identification of the most influential areas of afforestation with respect to the modification of the land‐atmosphere CS and the tree planting over those areas is referred to as the acupuncture‐like afforestation. While previous studies regarding deforestation and afforestation have focused on the impacts of vegetation on changes in the mean characteristics of surface temperature, precipitation, surface energy fluxes or large‐ and local‐scale circulations, this study emphasizes the significance of the hydrological coupling strength that takes into account only the anomalies of precipitation and evapotranspiration. One may expect that the increase in _placeholder_formula_ or _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ would be more important to mitigate desertification. However, with respect to hydrological extreme events such as floods and droughts, the climate variability rather than its average has been considered to be more important [ ; ]. Furthermore, changes in the climate variability (e.g., coupling strength) would induce a substantial change in the averages in a longer time scale, ultimately. We found that JJA mean soil moisture can increase, despite decreased _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ in many East Asian regions where the reduction of CS by vegetation was pronounced ( ). Namely, the mean precipitation is not always directly associated with the probability of drought over dry lands. We, therefore, demonstrated that changes in CS rather than those in the mean precipitation by tree planting are more decisive for desertification mitigation. This study revisited the conventional tree planting approach as an essential and effective strategy for desertification mitigation with respect to the hydrological coupling strength. One of the drawbacks of this study is lack of complete mechanical explanations about the connections between CS and soil moisture. It is necessary to further investigate detailed processes of the modulation of soil moisture by CS. Specifically, further studies require careful and profound analyses considering complete hydrological cycles among the atmosphere, soil, and vegetation with respect to both mean and anomaly fields of hydrological variables, based on much longer simulations than 5 years. This remains to be investigated as the future study. Another drawback of this study is related with a dependency of vegetation species on CS. Based on the effect of the currently dominant vegetation types on the CS, this study focused on the question of where to plant to combat desertification. The question of which species strengthen or weaken CS in terms of desertification mitigation remains significant, although it is suggested that crop (grass) is likely to weaken (intensify) CS ( and ) in this study. Unfortunately, adaptation of the multiple PFTs at a grid in CLM prevents further analyses from finding the answers to the latter question. In addition, assuming prescribed vegetation, interactions and feedback between vegetation and climate are not considered in this study. Therefore, future studies should enlighten the dependency of vegetation species and the impact of interactions between vegetation and climate on CS. This study dealt with the climatic impact of vegetation in the present climate only. However, many future projections of the double CO 2 environments using general circulation models (GCMs) show that the short‐term and long‐term drought frequencies would increase greatly over the globe since they are associated with changes in Hadley circulations and northward replacement of major storm tracks in the northern hemisphere [ ; ]. Especially over the Mediterranean and southern Europe, one of the high‐risk frequent drought regions, enhanced precipitation‐temperature‐soil moisture coupling in the double CO 2 climate has been simulated [ ; ]. In this circumstance, the acupuncture‐like afforestation is expected to lessen the potential impacts of global warming on drought probability and desert expansion. This study examined only the vegetation‐induced hydrological coupling between the atmosphere and land surface, especially during the summer, although desertification can also be locally affected by nonmeteorological factors e.g., chemical and biological deterioration of the soil [ ; ; ] and changes in land use due to grazing, cultivation, and fire [ ] induced by human interferences. However, these nonmeteorological factors may eventually alter CS through various effects as well and can affect desertification. Consequently, one has to be attentive to CS modulation and its influences on desertification mitigation.

We thank anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on an earlier draft of this article."},{"id":5,"value":"Introduction Changes in vegetation greenness have been recognized as modifying the climate and the energy budget of the earth through both biophysical and biochemical processes [ Bonan , ; Levis , ]. However, the role of vegetation in influencing hydro‐climate is very controversial, and debates on this topic are usually divided into “demand‐side” and “supply‐side” schools [ Ellison et al ., ]. The “demand‐side” school suggests that an increase in vegetation could consume water and reduce runoff, which would lead to a water availability decline, especially in small‐scale regions, while the “supply‐side” school argues that the overall impacts of vegetation, particularly forests, are positive for water supply. For example, Makarieva and Gorshkov [ , ] hypothesized that a “biotic pump” mechanism in continuous extensive natural forests far from coasts but having extensive borders with larger water bodies may exist. They argued that those forest covers, though far from oceans, could attract and pump moisture back into the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration (ET), and then, the rate at which moisture is recirculated in the form of ET may in turn have an impact on the frequency and duration of precipitation events. Although different perspectives exist, it is thought that vegetation greenness is inextricably linked to atmospheric water vapor. Until now, most studies have emphasized the role of the “biotic pumps” of interior forests from the coastal regions in altering moisture transportation and even atmospheric circulation, and several observations have been cited to support this claim [ Angelini et al ., ; Makarieva et al ., ; Makarieva et al ., ; Spracklen et al ., ; Viste and Sorteberg , ; Sheil and Murdiyarso , ; Makarieva et al ., ]. However, the number of studies exploring the effects of vegetation on changes in atmospheric water shortage (e.g., precipitable water, or PW) is small [ McGuire et al ., ]. Although some modeling studies have recently indicated that the climatic effect of changes in long‐wave radiation flux brought about by additional water vapor through ET, due to increased vegetation in middle‐high northern latitudes, cannot be neglected, particularly in water‐limited regions [ Rotenberg and Yakir , ; Swann et al ., ; Swann et al ., ], direct evidence has still not been obtained. Water vapor plays a major role as a dominant feedback variable in the hydrological cycle and in radiative forcing, which impacts both global and local weather as well as climate. Water vapor in the lower troposphere not only acts as the main resource for precipitation in all weather processes by providing latent heating [ Trenberth et al ., ], but also influences the planetary radiative balance through cloud formation. Moreover, as a natural, important, and abundant greenhouse gas, water vapor helps maintain the Earth's surface temperature by absorbing and emitting long‐wave infrared radiation, which exerts a positive feedback on the changing climate system and strengthens the greenhouse effect [ Sudradjat et al ., ]. Therefore, it is important to seek evidence of the impact of vegetation on PW by analyzing various data. China is located within the Asian monsoon region, meaning that its moisture content and transportation are essentially controlled by monsoon circulations. During the summer (June, July, and August (JJA)), the Asian summer monsoons (east/south) bring abundant moisture to most of mainland China and influence its precipitation pattern [ Simmonds et al ., ]. The moisture pattern in northern China, particularly in the arid/semi‐arid parts of northwestern China, is also impacted by the westerly belt as well as by the ecosystem [ Sato et al ., ; Song and Zhang , ; Wu et al ., ]. Li et al . [ ] and Zheng et al . [ ] have noted that more attention needs to be paid to the influence of the land‐cover and land use changes as well as other anthropogenic activities on moisture patterns. In the last three decades, China has launched large‐scale ecosystem restoration programs (e.g., the Three‐North Forest Shelterbelt Program, the Grain for Green project, and the Natural Forest Conservation Program) [ Liu et al ., , ; Wang et al ., ], especially in its northern regions, to combat environmental deterioration. Because of these efforts, forest cover has increased dramatically from 8% in 1949 to 18.2% in 2005 [ Cao et al ., ]. Northern China encompasses the three geographic regions of northwestern, northern, and northeastern China. These regions are severely short of water, especially the northwest. Annual precipitation is less than 400 mm over most of this region, even less than 200 mm in the northwest and therefore northern China is usually defined as a water‐limited region. Because of the water shortages, the climatic effects of changes in vegetation greenness in this region have attracted worldwide attention. Previous studies of the impact of vegetation greenness change on climate in China have ranged from modeling [ Bi et al ., ; Liu et al ., , ; Yu et al ., ; Zheng et al ., ] to observational analysis [ Duan et al ., ; Wu et al ., ; Yang et al ., ], but few have explored changes in water vapor in relation to the vegetation greenness change. Rangwala et al . [ ] found that warming in the Tibetan Plateau has possibly been influenced by increases in water vapor, but the contributions of vegetation greenness change were not explored in their study. This study aims to investigate whether water vapor has been significantly influenced by vegetation greenness changes in the summer (JJA) over northern China and to explore the possible physical mechanisms. Details of the data sets used in this study and the analytical approach selected are provided in . describes the observed variations in water vapor in China, explores the relationship between water vapor and vegetation greenness, and discusses possible physical mechanisms for this relationship. provides concluding remarks. Methodology Data and Study Region Vegetation greenness can be characterized using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data [ Liang et al ., ]. This research used the monthly, 8 km Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies NDVI products from 1982 to 2008, which are derived from data of the Advanced High Resolution Radiometer on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar‐orbiting satellite [ Tucker et al ., ]. This data set has been widely used for research purposes. Monthly ET satellite products from 1983 to 2006 can be obtained from Zhang et al . [ ]. Meteorological precipitation monthly gridded products from 1982 to 2008 can be obtained from the Climatic Research Unit [ Mitchell and Jones , ]. Three PW data sets were validated to determine which worked best over China. These data sets included the NASA Modern Era Retrospective‐Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) [ Rienecker et al ., ], the NCEP Climate Forest System Reanalysis (NCEP/CFSR; [ Saha et al ., ]), and the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA‐Interim; [ Dee et al ., ]) with processed radiosonde station measurements by Dai et al . [ ] within China, station by station. The results are shown in Figure , which illustrates that in the summer in China, the accuracy of PW from MERRA was the most satisfactory. Therefore, the MERRA PW data set was selected for analysis in this research. All grid data sets have been aggregated into 0.5° × 0.5°, monthly data sets, and nonvegetated grids have been excluded [ Ma and Frank , ]. The 14 northern provinces in China were selected to represent northern China, as indicated in Figure . This area is considered to be one of the most environmentally vulnerable regions in China [ Huang et al ., ] and is characterized by a dry climate, severe water shortages, and land degradation. The last consists primarily of desertification caused by wind erosion, especially in the northern and northwestern parts. Except for the northeastern region, the major types of vegetation in this area are grasses and shrubs. Circulation Indices Most of the moisture over China is controlled by atmospheric circulations. The Asian summer monsoon (east/south) and the northern mid‐high latitude westerly circulation are the main sources of moisture [ Zhang et al ., ]. Therefore, the three atmospheric circulation indices used in this study include the East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI), the South Asian Summer Monsoon Index (SASMI), and the Westerly Index (WI). The EASMI is a shear vorticity index, which is defined by U850 averaged in (22.5°N–32.5°N, 110°E–140°E) minus U850 in (5°N–15°N, 90°E–130°E), where U850 is the zonal wind averaged over the summer season (June‐August) at 850 hPa. This index is the Wang and Fan [ ] index with a reverse sign and was recommended by Wang et al . [ ]. The SASMI is an improved index developed by Shi et al . [ ] based on the Webster and Yang index [ Webster and Yang , ]. The improved SASMI is the optimal linear combination of the zonal wind shear U850 averaged in (7.5°N–20°N, 37.5°E–90°E) and U200 averaged in (5°N–35°N, 40°E–90°E), expressed as (2.4U850–U200), where U850 and U200 denote the zonal wind average over the season (June‐September) at 850 hPa and 200 hPa, respectively. WI is an index which measures the strength of the midlatitude westerly circulation and was developed by Rossby [ ]. Here WI was calculated as _placeholder_formula_ [ Wu et al ., ], where H denotes the zonal‐average height at 500 hPa. According to Li et al . [ ] and Yan et al . [ ], three regions were selected for calculating the regional summer (June‐August) WI i (i=1,2,3) (region1: 30°E–70°E; region2: 70°E–110°E; region3:110°E–140°E), which have a close relationship with the hydro‐climate within China. All the indices were generated using the MERRA reanalysis data for consistency. Statistical Methods Several statistical methods were used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of the variables and their linkages in the summer from 1982 to 2008. Because the PW has a very short memory, only the simultaneous effects of variables were considered in the following analysis. The analysis proceeded in four steps. First, linear regression was carried out to analyze trends in summer NDVI and PW over China during this period. Second, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was conducted for summer PW anomalies. The EOF method is thought to be one of the most effective ways to explore the spatiotemporal structure of the long‐term variations of a variable over a specific area and is based on the covariance matrix. The summer PW anomalies were derived by removing the annual cycle (subtracting long‐term mean values) from all grid point time series. Third, Pearson's correlation was used to explore coupling between variables. To determine whether there is a persistent trend in the summer for northern China's PW and NDVI activity, a piecewise linear regression model [ Toms and Lesperance , ] was used to detect their turning points (TPs) in the fourth step. The model used is: _placeholder_formula_ where t is the year, y is summer (JJA) PW or NDVI, α is the TP of the summer PW or NDVI trend, β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 are regression coefficients, and ϵ; is the residual of the fit. The summer linear PW or NDVI trend is β 1 before the TP and β 1 + β 2 after it. α was determined by the least squares error method. TP was confined to the period from 1986 to 2002 to avoid linear regression in one period with too few data points, and the significance of TP was tested using a t test. A p value <0.1 was considered significant. For more details, the readers can refer to Wang et al . [ ]. These methods cannot quantify the effect of NDVI on PW. To explore further how terrestrial vegetation changes have impacted PW, it is necessary to consider the impacts of atmospheric circulations and the TP of PW together. Based on this assertion and the assumption that the relationship is linear, two scenarios were represented: The first takes into account only the influence of the circulations and can be written as: _placeholder_formula_ where ϵ; represents the residuals (or errors) of the regression; a , b , c , and d m are regression coefficients, which are estimated pixel by pixel by the ordinary least squares (OLS) method; X m(m=1,2,…,5) contains the circulation indices EASMI, SASMI, and WI i=1,2,3 , and optimal stepwise linear regression is used to select the most relevant circulation indices based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The variables “year” and “α” are included in equation to account for a possible trend and TP in the PW. This equation states that year‐to‐year changes in PW during the summer are linearly related to year‐to‐year changes in the atmospheric circulations. The second scenario incorporates the same variables and the observed summer NDVI together: _placeholder_formula_ This interactive scenario clarifies the influence of NDVI on PW, in which X m are the optimal selected circulation indices from equation , and all the coefficients were also estimated by the OLS. Finally, F‐test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the coefficient e in equation , which indicates to what extent a relation exists. The nature of this effect is indicated by the sign of e ; a positive value indicates that increases in NDVI increases PW. Results and Analysis The analytical results of the spatiotemporal variations and coupling between summer PW and NDVI in the study region are presented in this section. The effect of NDVI on PW has also been quantified. As a deeper analysis, the relations between ET, PW, and P are also explored to help clarify the physical mechanisms involved. Changes in Summer PW The first step was to examine the geographical distribution of the mean and the linear trend of summer PW based on the MERRA reanalysis data from 1982 to 2008 at the national scale, as shown in Figure . The spatial distribution of the summer PW means in Figure a indicates an obvious decreasing trend from east to west in China. The Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Gansu, and the southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region desert areas within western China show PW values less than 10 mm, while other eastern regions, which are mostly influenced by the Asian monsoon, have relatively abundant water vapor. Figure b shows the spatial pattern of summer PW trends during the same period with an average rate of 0.057 mm yr −1 . This means a general increasing trend in PW in most of China, and in several areas located in western China, such as the central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. To prove the reliability of the MERRA PW products further, the results for the linear trend of PW radiosonde measurements are also shown in Figure c, which show a generally similar pattern to Figure b. In other words, the dry arid/semi‐arid regions within northern China (delineated by the black line in Figure ) have been becoming moister in the last three decades. In addition to the 27 year climatology and summer PW trend, an examination of the spatiotemporal pattern of PW changes over the whole of northern China is interesting. An EOF analysis was conducted of the anomalies in summer PW from 1982 to 2008. Figure shows the first three leading modes of PW, which together explain 96.85% of the total variance. The first mode accounts for 67.72% of the variance; its spatial pattern (Figure a) is generally characterized by a same positive sign over the whole study region, while its corresponding Principal Component (PC) time series (Figure d) shows a generally increasing trend throughout the analysis period. This indicates that summer PW over northern China is most likely increasing. According to Zhai and Eskridge [ ] and Xie et al . [ ], this trend is strongly coupled with an increasing trend in surface temperature in the warm season. Moreover, there appears to be an increasing trend until 2000 and a relatively stable situation afterwards. The second mode (Figure b), which explains 23.63% of the variance, seems to separate the signal into a west‐east pattern. It is characterized by positive anomalies in the northern and northwestern arid/semi‐arid regions west of 110°E and negative anomalies in northeastern part of China and the southeastern and southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region. The associated PC time series in Figure e shows a sudden increasing trend after the mid to late1990s, reflecting an apparent strengthening in PW over the western arid/semi‐arid regions and a steady decrease in northeastern China since the mid‐1990s. Although the third mode of PW (Figure c) explains 5.50% of the variance, it indicates subregional dipole‐like PW changes from west to east. The corresponding time series (Figure f) shows an interannual variation and also a TP around the mid‐1990s. The three modes together reflect different patterns of PW variation in the western and eastern parts of northern China, as well as a change in summer PW patterns which has been occurring since the mid‐1990s or the beginning of the 2000s. These findings mostly agree with Xie et al . [ ]. However, the results of this research indicate that northeastern China has experienced a decreasing trend in summer PW, especially after the mid‐1990s, which is in disagreement with previous work [ Xie et al ., ; Zhai and Eskridge , ] due to the different periods considered. The northeastern region of China is mainly located north of 40°N and east of 115°E, and its moisture is controlled mostly by the East Asian summer monsoon. According to Zou et al . [ ] and Piao et al . [ ], the observations could be explained by the decreased EASM, warming, and droughts in recent decades. Besides, several studies did show a decline in moisture over the Tibet Autonomous Region [ Xie et al ., ; Wang and Guo , ], but this was not always found to be the case in the present research, whether using reanalysis data or radiosonde measurements (Figures b and c), and it is still unclear how this phenomenon is related to changes in surface vegetation. Therefore, PW variation is most likely different from west to east within northern China because of natural conditions. In addition, PW is notably more influenced by other factors in the western arid/semi‐arid regions of northern China. PW Links to Changes in NDVI Over Northern China To examine the links between PW and NDVI over northern China, the linear trend of maximum summer NDVI at the national scale from 1982 to 2008, as shown in Figure a, was examined. It shows strong spatial heterogeneity, but the great contrast between northern China (delineated by the black line) and southern China is very clear. Most of central and southern China showed a decreasing trend in summer NDVI, while northern China and most of its northwestern part had an increased NDVI from 1982 to 2008. Overall, an increased NDVI was found in 40.30% (90% significant increase in 18.45% of the pixels) of China's land area in the summer. This result is also consistent with those reported by Peng et al . [ ]. Both Figures b and a indicate that most regions of northern China, mainly in its central and western part, became greener and moister in summer from 1982 to 2008. Furthermore, a linear Pearson's correlation result between summer NDVI and PW over northern China from 1982 to 2008 is shown in Figure b. This result presents a positive relation, mostly in the western and central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which suggests that increased PW in these regions can possibly be attributed to increased summer NDVI. Although Figure b reveals a strong link between NDVI and PW in the study region, it does not take the TPs of the two variables into account. However, previous studies have explored and identified the TPs of vegetation changes. For example, Park and Sohn [ ] noted that a TP in vegetation variation observed in the mid‐1990s existed in mid‐high latitudes over the northern hemisphere from 1982 to 2006, and Peng et al . [ ] found that the change occurred around the 2000s in northern China in the growing season. Meanwhile, EOF modes 2 and 3 of the PW, as described in , also suggest that a TP appeared in the summer PW over northern China around the mid‐1990s. Therefore, if a coupling between PW and NDVI does exist, the geographical distribution of the TPs in the summer trends of the two variables should be similar. To determine whether this is true, a piecewise linear regression approach was used to identify the TPs of the summer PW and NDVI trends, with the results shown in Figures a and b, respectively. The spatial distributions of the trends in summer PW and NDVI before and after the PW TPs are displayed in Figures c–f. The significance level of the TPs in Figures a and b are both greater than 90%. Figure a shows that the TPs of summer PW occurred mostly in the northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the central Tibet Autonomous Region around the 2000s, which is most consistent with the TP distribution of summer NDVI in these areas (red box) as shown in Figure b. Figures c and e show the spatial distributions of the trend in summer PW before and after its TP. Clearly opposite trends can be observed when comparing these two plots. Before the PW TP, 94.27% of the pixels with significant TPs show an increasing trend in summer PW, which suggests a more humid climate in the western area over northern China. However, after the TP, the climate becomes more and more dry. At the same time, the trends in summer NDVI in these two hot spot regions (northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and central Tibet Autonomous Region) are consistent with PW; NDVI shows similar trends to PW, which again suggests that increased (decreased) vegetation may be attributed to a wetter (drier) climate in northwestern China. Overall, the analytical results demonstrate that the central and western parts of northern China are the most sensitive region for interaction between NDVI and PW, while PW in the northeastern region is influenced more by atmospheric circulations. Effects of NDVI on PW According to the analysis described above, NDVI changes are highly correlated with changes in PW in northern China in the summer, especially over the central and western arid/semi‐arid regions. The actual effect of vegetation changes on regional PW cannot be assessed without excluding the influences of atmospheric circulations. The impacts of major atmospheric circulations such as EASM, SASM, and WI, as mentioned in , are discussed below. By building two scenarios and using the optimal stepwise linear regression method, as well as taking into account the TPs of the PW, the standardized coefficient e in equation has been estimated pixel by pixel over northern China, with result shown in Figure . It is obvious that e is positive in most regions of northern China, particularly in the central and western water‐limited areas, and negative in the three provinces of northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning), south of the central provinces, and in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region. This result matches previous findings by the authors, and its pattern is similar to that shown in Figure b. This finding indicates that increased vegetation greenness in most northern nonmonsoon regions, as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region, is a possible reason for the observed increases in atmospheric water content, which has important implications for water cycle in this area, especially in arid/semi‐arid regions. After testing the significance of the e values using the F‐test , the pixels with a significance level greater than 90% were selected and are shown in Figure a. The corresponding variances in PW explained by the NDVI of these pixels, which are measured in terms of the difference between the square of the correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of the two scenarios, are shown in Figure b. Overall, there are four major regions where NDVI has positive influence on PW over northern China (indicated by red boxes in Figure a): the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (box 1), the northern of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (box 2), the Eastern Qinghai Province (box 3), and the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region (box 4). Figure b shows that almost all the R 2 values increased in the four regions, with the largest increase being as much as 30%, indicating that summer vegetation greenness in the four regions is very closely linked to PW and accounts for as much as 30% of the total PW variance from1982 to 2008. It is very interesting to note that all these regions are mountainous: the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is south of the Yin Mountains, the northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is north of the Tianshan Mountain area, the eastern part of Qinghai Province is located in the eastern Qilian Mountains, and the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region is part of the Himalayas. Due to their special topography and geolocation, these four regions have relatively abundant available water for vegetation, even for forest. Moreover, the first region (box 1) is within the ecological transitional zone, which is the most sensitive region for the vegetation‐climate interaction over northern China [ Dessler et al ., ]. Note that summer vegetation increased markedly in these regions during the study period, as shown in Figure a. The significantly negatively influenced regions, by contrast, are scarce and scattered. The vegetation activity in these regions makes little contribution to the variation of local PW, except for some forest areas in southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region. The ET process is a possible physical mechanism for the positive impact of vegetation changes on PW. Vegetation transpiration transfers water vapor into the atmosphere, meaning that increased vegetation greenness may contribute to the regional availability of atmospheric moisture vapor, in particular in arid and semi‐arid regions, where the hydro‐climate is closely linked to local moisture recycling, which is strongly affected by local vegetation greenness [ Makarieva et al ., ; Wang and Dickinson , ; Wu et al ., ]. Moreover, Ellison et al . [ ] assumed that forest‐driven ET process also contributes to the atmospheric moisture vapor cross‐continental transport and intensifies the regional water cycle, though Makarieva and Gorshkov [ ] claimed that this “biotic pump” could be created only by the intact contiguous cover of natural forest from the coastal regions. To verify their points, the correlation between summer season ET and PW over northern China was examined, with results shown in Figure a. Here only the period from 1983 to 2006 was analyzed because the ET data set was the only available data set. It is obvious that ET is generally positively correlated with PW, and most of the significant areas are located in the four regions shown in Figure a.This demonstrates that, on one hand, strengthened ET driven by increased vegetation greenness is one of the major sources for water vapor in the atmosphere, and on the other hand, the fact that ET is not strongly related to PW in some areas of the four hot spot regions (i.e., gray areas in box 1) demonstrates that increased forest cover over the four regions could help transport additional PW from regions with a surplus to other regions that lack adequate moisture availability. However, in regions where PW is controlled mostly by monsoons, such as the northeast, the effect of vegetation on PW is minor, although forest cover has increased markedly. It is also noteworthy that vegetation greenness in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region is negatively correlated with regional water vapor and that vegetation here decreased during the study period (Figure a). According to Zhang et al . [ ], the increased vegetation greenness in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region is influencing the Bowen ratio, which tends to enhance vertical ascending motion and forces more atmospheric moisture to precipitate out. Wang et al . [ ] also pointed out that the precipitable‐water conversion rates over southeastern Tibet decreased from 1970 to 2009, which is a possible reason that PW has increased. This may explain the decreased vegetation greenness accompanied by increased atmospheric water vapor in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous region. In addition, the thermal effect, which refers mainly to the alteration of air temperature due to change in the solar energy absorption and energy partitioning into latent and sensible fluxes accompanied by changes in vegetation and water vapor, also influences the PW by altering ET process and the water‐vapor holding capacity. The results shown in Figures a and b have verified our hypothesis that ET driven by increased vegetation greenness makes a major contribution to increased atmospheric water vapor in water‐shortage‐afflicted northwestern China. Nevertheless, the opposite hypothesis that increased PW causes increased NDVI through increased precipitation might still be proposed. It is worth noting that the precipitation that occurs barely satisfies the needs for vegetation growth in the arid/semi‐arid areas of northwestern China, even in the summer season in which most precipitation occurs. If this is the case, then the spatial pattern of the correlation between precipitation and PW should be similar to that between ET and PW. Further examination reveals that the correlation between precipitation and PW (see Figure c) does not exhibit patterns similar to Figure b and the relation is especially poor for the four hot regions. This helps to demonstrate that increased vegetation greenness in the summer would increase local water vapor within the nonmonsoon‐impacted, water‐shortage‐afflicted northwestern China region. Moreover, this conclusion is also supported by some numerical simulation studies [ Liu et al ., , ]. Summary and Discussions Water vapor is an important greenhouse gas that accounts for 50% to 75% of the greenhouse effect today [ Ravishankara , ] and is a key driver of many atmospheric processes. Although the positive trend in the summer PW over China, especially in northern China, has been documented by many previous studies [ Li et al ., ; Xie et al ., ; Zhai and Eskridge , ], this study has demonstrated that this trend can be largely attributed to increased vegetation greenness through ET after several ecosystem restoration projects have been implemented during the last three decades over northern China. This study began by examining the spatiotemporal variations of PW and vegetation and then established the relationship between changes in PW and vegetation changes in the summer (June‐August) over northern China using seasonal mean PW and maximum NDVI data for the period from 1982 to 2008. Finally, the effect of vegetation changes on local PW were identified and quantified by excluding the influences of major atmospheric circulations. An analysis of PW and NDVI data sets confirmed the general positive trends and the strong spatiotemporal coupling variations of these two variables in the summer over most of northern China, especially in its central and western parts. After removing the influences of atmospheric circulation indices (EASMI, SASMI, WI), the increases in NDVI were found to be partly responsible for increased atmospheric water‐vapor content over most parts of northern China, in particular the nonmonsoon interior water‐limited regions. This finding is consistent with those of Wu et al . [2012] for the Tarim River Basin. Further analyses were conducted to identify the most sensitive regions for vegetation‐PW interaction, and four regions where NDVI had significant positive impact on PW were identified. In these regions, NDVI can account for as much as 30% of the variance in PW. To explore how increased vegetation greenness strengthens PW in the four regions, the relation between ET and NDVI and, between ET and PW from 1983 to 2006 and the correlation between precipitation and PW from 1982 to 2008 were investigated in the four regions. All the results suggested that (1) ET controlled by terrestrial vegetation is one of the major sources of regional atmospheric water vapor in interior regions far from oceans, and (2) in mountainous areas, mainly covered by forest due to the adequate water supply, the local moisture cycle is intensified and reinforced because of the ecological functions of forest besides ET. Based on this evidence, it can be concluded that vegetation is very important to the moisture cycle in arid/semi‐arid regions over northern China. In regions where water is amply sufficient for vegetation, the presence of forest can have more influence on moisture cycling. These findings have great implications for assessments of the greenhouse effect and water‐resources management in water‐limited regions. However, other factors, such as changes in glacial extent, irrigation, and drought over northern China, need to be further explored. The nonlinear relation between vegetation and PW also needs to be explored in a subsequent study.

Satellite‐based measurements of temperature and long‐lived constituents [e.g., Wu et al. , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Garcia et al. , ; Tunbridge et al. , ], in combination with satellite‐based wind observations [ Wu et al. , ; Lieberman , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Gu et al. , ], have shown that Q2DW amplitudes peak in the extratropical MLT during both Southern Hemisphere (SH) and Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer shortly after solstice. As an example, Figure plots temperature and meridional wind anomalies at 40°N and 0.02 hPa (~75 km) during July 2009 showing longitude‐time behavior consistent with a westward propagating Q2DW. The Q2DW originates primarily from baroclinically unstable regions near the summertime mesospheric easterly jet. Current theory indicates that these regions produce fast‐growing instabilities that can project onto the zonal wave number 3 global Rossby‐gravity mode [ Salby , ; Plumb , ; Pfister , ; Lieberman , ; Rojas and Norton , ]. One key aspect of the Q2DW that is not yet well understood is the cause of its intermittency, i.e., it is often observed in “bursts” throughout the summer season (see, e.g., 1–10 July and 20–25 July in Figure ). As a result, the observed Q2DW can exhibit a high degree of both intraseasonal and interannual variability that has been extensively documented in both ground‐based and satellite‐based data sets [e.g., Wu et al. , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Garcia et al. , ; Tunbridge et al. , ; Offermann et al. , ]. Modeling studies suggest that this variability can have a wide‐ranging effect on, e.g., summer polar mesopause temperatures [ Pendlebury , ], thermospheric neutral winds [ Chang et al. , ], and ionospheric electron content [ Yue et al. , ]. Investigating the origins of Q2DW variability can therefore improve our overall understanding of MLT dynamics. Conditions for baroclinic instability are extremely sensitive to gradients in background zonal wind and temperature, which in the MLT arise through complex interactions involving gravity wave drag and solar tides. Norton and Thuburn [ ] used a global circulation model (GCM) to demonstrate that the effect of gravity wave drag maintains the meridional and vertical gradients in the summertime MLT zonal wind distribution that are necessary for the growth of baroclinically unstable local modes. More recently, Ern et al. [ ] found observational evidence that enhanced gravity wave drag can trigger Q2DW activity by decelerating the summertime mesospheric easterly jet. Salby and Callaghan [ ] showed that the presence of the migrating diurnal solar tide in a primitive equation model can increase the damping of the Q2DW and thus limit its growth under solstice conditions through nonlinear wave‐wave interactions. Nonlinear interactions between the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide can also cause a rapid growth in Q2DW amplitude and a contemporaneous (albeit smaller) reduction in the diurnal tidal amplitude. This process was first noted in the observational study by Teitelbaum and Vial [ ], and later described in several modeling studies [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Salby and Callaghan , ; Chang et al. , ]. Key factors determining whether or not this rapid amplification of the Q2DW will occur are a strong easterly jet in the summer upper mesosphere and phase locking of the Q2DW with the diurnal cycle (i.e., a 48 h period) [ Walterscheid and Vincent , ]. These conditions, and subsequent Q2DW‐tide interactions, have been observed in the SH summer MLT [ Hecht et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ], but it is not clear whether or not such processes also contribute to variability in the Q2DW during NH summer. Here we examine the roles of both baroclinic instability mechanisms and possible Q2DW‐tidal interactions in controlling Q2DW intermittency in the NH summer extratropical MLT. Doing so requires a data set of global winds and temperatures extending throughout the MLT region with sufficient temporal resolution to separate the Q2DW and tidal signatures. Presently, such information cannot be obtained from a single set of observations, but can instead be obtained by combining multiple sets of MLT observations using a high‐altitude data assimilation system (HDAS). This study examines Q2DW and tidal variability using 6‐hourly synoptic meteorological analyses of winds and temperature from the surface to 90 km altitude over the June–August periods of 2007–2009 produced by the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System with Advanced Level Physics‐High Altitude (NOGAPS‐ALPHA). The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS has been used previously to describe Q2DW variability in the SH extratropics during January [ McCormack et al. , ], and to provide evidence of nonlinear Q2DW‐tidal interactions in the extratropical SH summer MLT region [ McCormack et al. , ]. This is the first study using HDAS fields to examine the behavior of the Q2DW and tides in the NH summer. Although the amplitude of the Q2DW in the NH is smaller than its SH counterpart, it has a more complex spatial structure consisting of zonal wave numbers 2–4 whose relative amplitudes vary over the course of the season [ Tunbridge et al. , ]. We employ space‐time spectral analysis of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields to discriminate among the different spatiotemporal components of the Q2DW and the diurnal tide, which is not possible using ground‐based data sets or asynoptic satellite records alone, given their limitations in spatial and temporal coverage. This information is used to characterize the intraseasonal and interannual variability in the NH Q2DW in relation to the migrating diurnal tide. NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds are also used as input for a linear instability model to diagnose the origin and growth of the Q2DW throughout the NH summer via baroclinic instability. The results of this investigation indicate that the strength and location of the midlatitude mesospheric easterly jet core is the main factor controlling the behavior of the Q2DW during NH summer. The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS system and data analysis techniques are described in . presents the intraseasonal and interannual variability in the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide during NH summer of 2007–2009. discusses the origin and propagation of the Q2DW using diagnostic wave activity calculations. presents results from a linear instability model that uses NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilated winds to examine how the Q2DW arises from baroclinically unstable regions near the summer easterly jet. contains a summary of these results and discusses future research directions. Data and Methodology The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS assimilates operational meteorological observations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere in combination with research satellite observations of middle atmospheric temperature, ozone, and water vapor to provide a comprehensive analysis of atmospheric state variables from the surface to ~90 km. In this section, we first present a brief overview of the HDAS system. For a complete description of the production version of NOGAPS‐ALPHA, see Eckermann et al. [ ]. We then discuss the methods used to analyze the behavior of the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide in the NH summer MLT. NOGAPS‐ALPHA Description NOGAPS‐ALPHA is built upon the framework of the NOGAPS numerical weather prediction and analysis system that originally extended from the surface to 1 hPa (~50 km). It consists of two main components: a global spectral forecast model [ Hogan and Rosmond , ], and a three‐dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation algorithm [ Daley and Barker , ]. To expand this system's meteorological analysis capability through the middle atmosphere, the vertical domain of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA forecast model was raised to ~100 km [ Hoppel et al. , ], and a 68‐level (L68) hybrid σ − p vertical coordinate was introduced [ Eckermann , ], giving ~2 km spacing of levels throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere. In the present study, the forecast model component of NOGAPS‐ALPHA uses a T79 horizontal wave number truncation to give an effective horizontal grid spacing of 1.5° in longitude and latitude on a quadratic Gaussian grid. Extending NOGAPS‐ALPHA into the middle atmosphere required the addition of several new physics packages, as described in Eckermann et al. [ ]. These include improved shortwave heating and longwave cooling rates [ Chou et al. , ; Chou and Suarez , ], updated parameterizations of subgrid scale orographic [ Palmer et al. , ] and nonorographic gravity wave drag [ Eckermann , ], and linearized photochemical parameterizations for middle atmospheric ozone and water vapor [ McCormack et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ], which are both prognostic model variables in NOGAPS‐ALPHA. The data assimilation component of NOGAPS‐ALPHA is based on the NRL Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System [ Daley and Barker , ], a 3DVAR system with a 6 h update cycle that assimilates both conventional ground‐based observations (e.g., wind, pressure, and temperature from station reports and radiosondes) and operational satellite‐based observations (e.g., microwave radiances, surface winds, and precipitable water). In addition, NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilates Aura MLS Version 2.2 temperature, O 3 , and H 2 O profile measurements [ Hoppel et al. , ]. The Aura satellite completes ~13 orbits per day with coverage between 82°S and 82°N latitude. NOGAPS‐ALPHA also assimilates Version 1.07 temperature profile measurements from the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Radiometry (SABER) instrument, which is a side‐viewing instrument whose latitude coverage alternates every 2 months to view high latitudes in both hemispheres. During NH summer, in mid‐July, SABER switches from its north viewing mode (latitude range of 83°N to 52°S) to south viewing mode (52°N to 83°S). This change in coverage is not seen to affect the assimilated Q2DW in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses, which is generally largest equatorward of 50°N. The bulk of the information on the Q2DW and tides in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses comes from MLS and SABER temperature profiles that are assimilated between the 32 and 0.002 hPa pressure levels. The vertical resolution of the SABER temperature retrieval remains ~2 km throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere while the resolution of the MLS temperature retrieval degrades from ~3 km in the stratosphere to ~13 km near the 0.01 hPa level. Global mean systematic biases of 2–3 K between the MLS and SABER temperatures have been removed prior to assimilation to avoid introducing spurious spatial variability into the temperature analyses, as described in the work of Hoppel et al. [ ]. To obtain accurate heating and cooling rates in the middle atmosphere, NOGAPS‐ALPHA also assimilates daily MLS H 2 O and O 3 profiles between 220–0.002 hPa and 215–0.02 hPa, respectively [ Eckermann et al. , ]. To investigate the Q2DW in the NH MLT, the present study analyzes global synoptic zonal and meridional wind fields produced by the NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS. NOGAPS‐ALPHA does not directly assimilate middle atmospheric wind measurements; instead, it uses a formulation of the gradient wind approximation in the off‐diagonal elements of the observation error covariance matrix to produce balanced wind and temperature increments. These increments are integrated forward in time by the forecast model component, and the resulting middle atmospheric wind fields are further constrained by the physical parameterizations in the model (e.g., gravity wave drag, diffusion, etc.). As previous studies have shown [ McCormack et al. , , ] the resulting 6‐hourly global wind and temperature fields have the spatial and temporal resolutions necessary to discriminate between the Q2DW and diurnal tide in the SH summer MLT; the present study extends these investigations to the NH summer. A critical test of any assimilation system is verification with independent observations. For middle atmospheric winds and temperatures, these types of observations consist mainly of ground‐based radar and lidar measurements over a relatively small number of locations. Eckermann et al. [ ] and Stevens et al. [ ] showed that diurnal and semidiurnal variations in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT wind and temperature fields agree well with independent ground‐based observations at high northern latitudes during the 2007 summer season. McCormack et al. [ ] also showed good agreement between the Q2DW in NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT winds and medium‐frequency radar winds over Adelaide during January 2006 and January 2008. Furthermore, NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds compared well with Tromsø meteor radar winds at 70°N during January 2009 [ Coy et al. , ]. To demonstrate that NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT winds used in the present study can capture the day‐to‐day variability in the Q2DW seen in ground‐based data sets during NH summer, Figure compares meridional winds at 88 km altitude from meteor radar observations [ Singer et al. , ] over Kühlungsborn (54°N, 12°E) with corresponding NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds at 0.0036 hPa during July and August 2007. To facilitate the comparison, a five‐point smoothing was applied to the hourly meteor wind values in order to reduce high‐frequency variability. As Figure shows, there is good overall agreement between the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyzed winds and the meteor radar winds at this location. Specifically, both data sets exhibit 2 day periodicities during days 195–203 with similar amplitude and phase. This agreement is notable given the fact that no wind information is directly assimilated by NOGAPS‐ALPHA, as discussed in . There are also times during July–August 2007 when significant differences occur between the NOGAPS‐ALPHA and meteor radar winds, e.g., on days 205–206, which may be due to gravity wave activity at small scales which cannot be resolved by the assimilation system. Although additional comparisons are desirable to fully verify the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses, results to date clearly demonstrate that the 6‐hourly analyzed winds can capture key features of the Q2DW. Space‐Time Spectral Analysis To describe the characteristics of the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide, we use a two‐dimensional fast Fourier transform (2DFFT) approach following Hayashi [ ], where NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields at a given latitude and pressure level are expanded as Fourier series in longitude and time. Following the procedure described in McCormack et al. [ ], daily zonal means are subtracted from each 6‐hourly longitude‐time field and then a cosine taper is applied to the first and last 10% of each record in time. The resulting space‐time power spectrum describes the amount of variance at each frequency and zonal wave number. The 2DFFT is applied over a 32 day interval to derive results for an individual month. It is also applied over a 75 day interval to obtain results over the summer period from early June to early August. Figure plots the resulting normalized power spectra derived for a 32 day period (128 points) of 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields from 30 June to 31 July 2009 at 0.02 hPa (~75 km) and 40°N (see Figure ). The 2DFFT method can identify both westward and eastward propagating features that are associated, by convention, with positive and negative frequency values, respectively. At this particular level, only westward features are found and so only positive frequencies are plotted. The results of the 2DFFT in Figure show that most of the variance in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields at this location is found in westward propagating zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 with frequencies between 0.45 and 0.60 cpd. By examining 2DFFT spectra from all NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and wind fields over the NH from 1 to 0.002 hPa during July of 2007–2009, we find that power at zonal wave 3 consistently peaks in the frequency range 0.4–0.53 cpd, while power at zonal wave 4 consistently peaks between 0.5 and 0.625 cpd. This combination of waves 3 and 4 at periods near 2 days in Figure agrees with the study of MLS temperatures by Tunbridge et al. [ ], who found the Q2DW during July 2009 to consist primarily of westward zonal wave numbers 3 and 4. In this particular case, we do not find a westward wave 2 component in the power spectra plotted in Figure at 0.02 hPa and 40°N. However, our analysis does find a relatively weak wave 2 component in both wind and temperature at altitudes above 80 km, which is discussed further in . Figure b also indicates variance in the meridional wind field at wave 1 centered on 1 cpd associated with the migrating diurnal tide. A corresponding [1,1] feature is not seen in the temperature power spectra (Figure a) for this particular location. This is due to the latitude structure of the temperature tide in the upper mesosphere, which peaks near the equator and falls off more rapidly with latitude than the meridional wind tide. (The altitude and latitude structure of the tidal response in temperature and meridional wind derived from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses is discussed in more detail in .) It should be noted that although spectral analysis of the 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA output can resolve frequencies down to 2 cpd, the 3DVAR system's ±3 h assimilation window may not be able to fully capture this high‐frequency variability associated with, e.g., the semidiurnal tide. Therefore, this study focuses on possible interactions between the Q2DW and diurnal tide. To study the behavior of the Q2DW and diurnal tide throughout the NH summer season, 6‐hourly longitude/time fields of the individual Q2DW and tide components in the wind and temperature fields are reconstructed by applying appropriate band‐pass filters to the inverse 2DFFT. Based on the analysis of the 2DFFT power spectra described above, pass bands from 0.4–0.53 cpd to 0.5–0.625 cpd are used to isolate the westward propagating zonal wave 3 and 4 components of the Q2DW, respectively. A pass band at zonal wave number 1 from 0.9 to 1.1 cpd is used for the diurnal tide. The root‐mean‐square (RMS) amplitudes of the zonal wave number 1, 3, and 4 components are then calculated from the filtered fields at each latitude and pressure for every time step. Eddy heat and momentum fluxes are also calculated from these filtered fields, and are then used to formulate Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux diagnostics of wave activity associated with the Q2DW. This technique has been applied previously to NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields to investigate the evolution of the Q2DW and diurnal tide in the SH summer mesosphere [ McCormack et al. , , ]. In the present study, we extend this analysis to focus on the NH summers of 2007–2009. 2DFFT Results This section presents detailed information on the latitude and altitude structure of the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide during NH summer obtained from the 2DFFT analysis of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields. This section also discusses both the interannual and intraseasonal variability of these features during June–August of 2007–2009. Interannual Variability of the Q2DW and Diurnal Tide Figure plots mean values of the RMS amplitude for the westward propagating zonal wave number 3 component of the Q2DW in both temperature and meridional wind (referred to in terms of its primary frequency and wave number as [0.5,3]) for the June‐July‐August (JJA) period of 2007–2009. In all three years, the spatial structure of the temperature Q2DW between 70 and 90 km is generally consistent with earlier observations of the NH summer [e.g., Tunbridge et al. , , Figure ]. Specifically, we find that the feature exhibits deep vertical extent throughout the mesosphere between 20°N and 55°N with a maximum in temperature near 40°N and 0.02 hPa (~75 km). Figure also shows that the peak JJA mean temperature amplitudes in this region vary from year to year, reaching 2.2 K in 2007, 2.7 K in 2008, and 3.0 K in 2009. An analysis of the Q2DW by Gu et al. [ ] also found similar interannual variations, i.e., higher Q2DW amplitudes during NH summer 2009 compared to 2007 and 2008. Another maximum in [0.5,3] temperature amplitude is noted in all three years between 50°N and 60°N above 0.002 hPa (~90 km), reaching 2.0 K, 3.3 K, and 3.1 K in 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively (Figures a, c, and e). While this feature appears to be related to the maximum in the [0.5,3] meridional wind component near 95 km (Figures b, d, and f), it should be regarded with some caution as it lies above the top pressure level of 0.002 hPa where MLS and SABER temperature observations are assimilated. For the purposes of this study, we limit discussion of the Q2DW to the altitude region below the 0.002 hPa level (~90 km), where NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields are constrained by observations. The interannual variability in JJA mean meridional wind [0.5,3] amplitudes shown in Figure matches that of the JJA mean temperature amplitudes. For the 3 years analyzed, the Q2DW in meridional wind is strongest in 2009 and weakest in 2007. The spatial structure of the meridional wind [0.5,3] component is consistent from year to year, exhibiting a poleward tilt with increasing height and a maximum at 90 km between 40°N and 50°N. These features are in good qualitative agreement with model simulations of the [0.5,3] feature in meridional wind [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Salby and Callaghan , ; Chang et al. , ], lending confidence in the fidelity of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional wind analyses. A comparison of the spatial structure of the JJA mean [0.5,3] temperature and meridional wind components in Figure shows that the Q2DW in meridional wind does not exhibit the two distinct peaks near 75 km and 90 km seen in the temperature Q2DW. Instead, the amplitude of the meridional wind Q2DW increases steadily with altitude and peaks at 90 km. The spatial structure of the meridional wind Q2DW in Figure is consistent with the interpretation of the Q2DW as a global normal mode, which grows with altitude as atmospheric density decreases until vertical propagation is limited by, e.g., the presence of a critical line where the background wind speed equals the phase speed of the wave. The Q2DW in temperature arises from meridional parcel displacements superimposed upon a background meridional gradient in zonal mean temperature, and the double peak in the temperature Q2DW is produced by the vertical structure in this background temperature gradient throughout the NH summer MLT region. Specifically, maxima in the [0.5,3] temperature amplitude near 0.02 hPa and 0.001 hPa in Figure occur where the meridional gradients in zonal mean temperature are most pronounced; the minimum in the Q2DW temperature amplitude between 0.01 and 0.002 hPa occurs where the meridional temperature gradient is relatively weak. Figure plots the JJA mean amplitudes of the [0.5,4] component in NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperatures and meridional winds. While the latitude and altitude dependences of the [0.5,4] temperature component are similar to the [0.5,3] component, we find that the peak values of [0.5,4] in temperature are located on average ~5° equatorward and ~10–12 km lower than the location of the [0.5,3] temperature peaks. Peak values of the [0.5,4] meridional wind response are also shifted equatorward by ~5°, on average, relative to the peak [0.5,3] wind values. One main difference between the zonal wave number 3 and 4 features, however, is that the [0.5,4] meridional wind amplitudes do not exhibit the sharp increase with height seen in the [0.5,3] wind amplitudes. Another important difference is that, on average, both the peak temperature and wind amplitudes of [0.5,4] are 30% less than the amplitudes of [0.5,3]. We note here that Tunbridge et al. [ ] found evidence for a westward zonal wave number 2 feature associated with the Q2DW in NH summer based on analysis of MLS temperatures from 2004 to 2009. Our 2DFFT analysis of NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperatures finds that peak amplitudes for this [0.5,2] component are typically less than 1.5 K and, unlike the zonal wave 3 and 4 cases, are found over a broad latitude region from 10°N to 70°N above ~80km. The latitude and altitude dependences of the [0.5,2] component in meridional wind (not shown) are also markedly different from the zonal wave number 3 and 4 cases, showing peak values of ~10 m s −1 throughout the upper mesosphere centered over the equator. Because this apparent wave number 2 Q2DW exhibits spatial characteristics that are fundamentally different from [0.5,3] to [0.5,4] results, the present study will focus on the dynamical factors controlling the growth and evolution of wave number 3 and 4 components of the Q2DW in NH summer. Possible relationships between these components and the zonal wave number 2 Q2DW will be examined in a future study. One distinct advantage of 6‐hourly global HDAS output is the ability to discriminate among the diurnal migrating (or [1,1]) tide and the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW. As discussed in , there is both theoretical and observational evidence of mutual interaction between the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide. Most of these studies, however, focus on the SH summer period when Q2DW amplitudes are larger than during NH summer. We next examine the general characteristics of the [1,1] tide obtained from the 2DFFT analysis for June–August of 2007–2009. Figure plots the mean [1,1] RMS amplitudes in both temperature and meridional wind for JJA 2007–2009. The latitude and altitude structure of the tidal amplitudes derived from NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields are quite similar from year to year, and are in good agreement with earlier modeling studies [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Chang et al. , ]. At 0.02 hPa and 40°N, where the [0.5,3] temperature amplitudes are large (as indicated by the symbols in Figure b, d, and f), the JJA mean [1,1] amplitudes in meridional wind are greater in 2007 than in either 2008 or 2009. The larger [1,1] meridional wind amplitudes in JJA 2007 at this location coincide with relatively smaller Q2DW amplitudes observed during JJA 2007. As noted in , larger amplitudes of the migrating diurnal tide can limit the growth of the Q2DW. The interannual variations in tidal amplitudes seen in Figure can be caused by a variety of different factors, including variations in the strength of tidal forcing (i.e., latent heat release and ozone heating), and variations in the strength of the zonal winds in MLT. The latter is highly dependent on gravity wave drag, and wind variations in the stratosphere can act as a filter for upward propagating gravity waves. An analysis of TIMED Doppler Interferometer winds from 2002 to 2007 by Wu et al. [ ] found that amplitudes of the migrating diurnal tide tend to be larger during the westerly phase of the stratospheric quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO). We note that the QBO was in its easterly phase during July 2007; during July 2008 and 2009, winds in the equatorial lower stratosphere were westerly. Therefore, it does not appear that the QBO can explain the interannual variations in the Northern subtropical tidal amplitudes shown in Figure . Although the origins of the interannual variability in the diurnal tide are currently not understood, the JJA mean Q2DW amplitudes and diurnal tide in Figures are consistent with the interpretation that larger tidal amplitudes can limit the growth of the Q2DW. We examine the relationship between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide in more detail in . Intraseasonal Variability of the Q2DW We next examine the variability of the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components over the course of each summer period (June–August). As described in , this is done by applying a band‐pass filter at zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 to the inverse 2‐D Fourier transform of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields over a 75 day interval from 5 June to 20 August of each year. To facilitate comparisons with Q2DW variability seen in the SH summer reported by McCormack et al. [ ], we will focus on the seasonal evolution of the Q2DW during NH summer in NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional wind fields. We note that the time behavior of both the Q2DW and diurnal tide in temperature during NH summer (not shown) closely matches the time behavior of these features in meridional wind. Figure plots [0.5,3] amplitudes in meridional wind at 0.02 hPa (~ 75 km) as a function of latitude and time throughout the NH summers of 2007–2009. In all three cases, the [0.5,3] amplitudes peak shortly after solstice and then again 15–20 days later. There is also evidence of a weaker third peak in August. Our analysis of the three JJA periods finds the largest [0.5,3] amplitude of 17 m s −1 occurs during 2009, which is consistent with the larger mean JJA amplitudes in both temperature and pressure during 2009 in Figure . Figure plots the [0.5,4] meridional wind amplitude at 0.02 hPa for the NH summers of 2007–2009. The time behavior of the wave number 4 Q2DW differs from the behavior of wave number 3 in that there are several peaks in amplitude throughout the summer period from late June to mid‐August. For example, [0.5,4] wind amplitudes of 12 m s −1 occur in August of 2007 and 2009, while in 2008 the maximum amplitude of 15 m s −1 occurs in mid‐July. As with the [0.5,3] amplitudes in Figure , the largest [0.5,4] amplitudes at this level also occur during JJA 2009. Overall, the meridional extent of the peak [0.5,4] amplitudes for all three summers at this level is narrower in latitude than for the [0.5,3] amplitudes in Figure . The two peaks in the [0.5,3] amplitudes following solstice are consistent with the results in Tunbridge et al. [ , Figure c]. This is to be expected, since NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilates the same MLS temperature observations (in addition to SABER temperature observations). Offermann et al. [ ] found similar behavior of the Q2DW from upper mesospheric OH temperature measurements at 51°N during 2004–2009, i.e., two peaks in Q2DW amplitude in early and late NH summer, although this study was not able to distinguish among different wave number components of the Q2DW. Offermann et al. [ ] also reported a peak in Q2DW temperature amplitudes in April, giving rise to an apparent triple‐peak structure throughout the NH spring‐summer period. Presently, NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields for NH spring are only available for the years 2008 and 2009. Our analysis of temperature and horizontal winds does not find evidence for Q2DW activity during April or May of 2008 and 2009. The study by Tunbridge et al. [ ] also found no significant Q2DW signal in MLS temperatures at 91 km during spring of 2008 and 2009 [ Tunbridge et al. , , Figure ]; however, Tunbridge et al. [ ] did report Q2DW temperature amplitudes of 2–3 K in spring of 2006. Since the study by Offermann et al. [ ] reports Q2DW amplitudes averaged over several years (e.g., 2005–2009), it is not possible to evaluate this apparent interannual variability in the NH spring Q2DW from their OH temperature measurements. Future studies that involve direct comparisons between NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields and independent ground‐based observations on a year‐by‐year basis throughout NH spring and summer would clarify this issue. Intraseasonal Variability of the Migrating Diurnal Tide The results in show that over the three NH summers examined, the largest Q2DW amplitudes occur in 2009, when the amplitudes of the diurnal tide are smallest. Earlier observational studies of the Q2DW during SH summer [e.g., Lima et al. , ; Pancheva , ; Hecht et al. , ] found an inverse relationship between the amplitudes of the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide. As discussed in , one explanation for this relationship is that larger diurnal tidal amplitudes can locally reinforce the Q2DW, which promotes instability and wave breaking that effectively limit the amplification of the Q2DW. Another explanation is that when Q2DW amplitudes are large, nonlinear interactions can take place between the [0.5,3] and [1,1] “parent” waves that produce “child” waves whose frequency/wave number characteristics are determined from combinations of the sums and differences of the parent waves. In this scenario, the cascade of energy to smaller scales causes the amplitude of the child waves to grow at the expense of the diurnal tide, producing anticorrelation between the Q2DW and diurnal tide shortly after summer solstice. Numerous modeling studies have documented this latter process in both NH and SH summer [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Chang et al. , ], as evidenced by rapid enhancement of the Q2DW along with a simultaneous decrease of ~20% in the amplitude of the diurnal tide and the emergence of spectral peaks in the meridional wind field at harmonics of the diurnal cycle at subtropical latitudes near 90 km. To determine whether the observed interannual variability in the Q2DW over the three NH summers can be attributed to possible Q2DW‐tidal interactions, we now examine the temporal variability of the [1,1] amplitudes in meridional wind in relation to the Q2DW. Figure plots the [1,1] meridional wind amplitude as a function of latitude and time at the 0.02 hPa level (~75 km) for the NH summer period of 2007–2009. The [1,1] signal is largely confined to the subtropical regions of each hemisphere, which is consistent with earlier studies [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Wu et al. , ; Lieberman , ; Chang et al. , ]. In all 3 years, the tidal amplitudes are at a minimum near solstice and tend to increase as the summer progresses. A comparison of Figures and shows that when [0.5,3] amplitudes in meridional wind between 20°N and 40°N were comparatively weak during July 2007 (Figure a), corresponding [1,1] amplitudes were comparatively strong, exceeding 5 m s −1 throughout much of the NH subtropics. The larger [0.5,3] amplitudes in July of 2008 and 2009 (Figures b and c, respectively) occur when tidal amplitudes were comparatively weaker (less than 5 m s −1 ) throughout the NH subtropics. While the results in Figure confirm the inverse relationship between the Q2DW and diurnal tide from 1 year to the next at ~75 km, there is no indication of correlation between the Q2DW and tide within an individual season that would indicate the presence of any type of mutual, nonlinear interaction. As noted above, this process has generally been found to occur at higher altitudes in the subtropical regions where the amplitudes of both the Q2DW and tide are much larger than they are at 75 km. To further investigate the possibility of nonlinear Q2DW‐tide interactions in NH summer, we have compared the intraseasonal variability of the [1,1], [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components in meridional wind over a range of NH latitudes from 0.1 to 0.002 hPa. As an example, Figure plots time series of the [0.5,3], [0.5,4], and [1,1] amplitudes derived from the 2DFFT analysis at 30°N and 0.0036 hPa (~88 km) over the JJA periods of 2007–2009. This level is chosen for the comparison based on the study by McCormack et al. [ ], which found anticorrelation between the [1,1] and [0.5,3] components of NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional winds in the SH summer at 0.0036 hPa and 30°S latitude and a resulting [1,6] “child‐wave” signature indicative of nonlinear interactions between the diurnal tide and Q2DW. To determine if such behavior is evident in the NH summer MLT region, we focus in particular on the month of July when the [0.5,3] amplitudes are generally largest. As Figure indicates, there is no evidence of a strong anticorrelation between [1,1] and either [0.5,3] or [0.5,4] at this location to indicate that the larger Q2DW amplitudes in 2008 or 2009 result from the Q2DW growing at the expense of the diurnal migrating tide via nonlinear wave‐wave interaction. Similar analysis at other pressure levels and latitudes throughout the NH summer MLT (not shown) confirms this result. We also find no signature of the [1,6] or other child waves in the power spectra of the wind fields that would indicate Q2DW‐tidal interactions. Instead, we find periods of both correlation and anticorrelation between the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, most notably during July of 2007 and 2009, suggesting that in some circumstances conditions may favor growth of both Q2DW modes, while in other circumstances one component of the Q2DW may be growing preferentially over another. Overall, the lack of a strong anticorrelation between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide within the individual seasons (illustrated in Figure ) indicates that year‐to‐year variability in the background state of the NH summertime mesosphere, rather than amplification of the Q2DW due to interaction with the tides, could be responsible for the interannual differences in the amplitudes of the Q2DW seen in Figures and . In the following section, we use the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological analyses to examine how variations in the background state affects the origin and growth of the Q2DW in NH summer. EP‐Flux Diagnostics In this section, we employ a series of diagnostic calculations to examine the origin and growth of the Q2DW in the NH summer based on linear quasi‐geostrophic theory. Such an approach has been used previously to study the behavior of the Q2DW near the stratopause [ Randel , ; Orsolini et al. , ; Limpasuvan et al. , ] and identify regions of baroclinic and/or barotropic instability favoring Q2DW growth and propagation using daily stratospheric meteorological fields. In the present work, we extend this type of analysis into the upper mesosphere using global synoptic NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields. A necessary condition for the growth of the Q2DW in the summer extratropical mesosphere via baroclinic instability is a reversal of the meridional gradient in zonal mean quasi‐geostrophic potential vorticity _placeholder_formula_ [see, e.g., Plumb , ; Pfister , ]. In spherical coordinates this is computed from the relation _placeholder_formula_ where φ is latitude, _placeholder_formula_ is the zonal mean zonal wind speed, H is the scale height, z is the log‐pressure vertical coordinate, N is the Brunt‐Vaisälä frequency, a is the Earth's radius, and Ω is the planetary rotation rate. As equation shows, reversals in _placeholder_formula_ (i.e., from positive to negative values) are determined by the curvature in the background zonal wind distribution. Consequently, accurate wind analyses are needed to diagnose baroclinic instability. Here we use global NOGAPS‐ALPHA horizontal wind and temperature fields on constant pressure surfaces to compute _placeholder_formula_ during July of 2007, 2008, and 2009, when the [0.5,3] amplitudes tend to be largest. This information shows how variations in baroclinic instability from one NH summer to the next may help to explain the observed interannual variations in the Q2DW amplitudes shown in Figures and . While reversal of _placeholder_formula_ is a necessary condition for Q2DW growth through baroclinic instability, it is not sufficient. Conditions must also support the growth of the disturbance in the absence of a critical line. Theory states that growth of the Q2DW is related to EP flux divergence in baroclinically unstable regions [e.g., Plumb , ]. The EP flux vector can be computed from the eddy heat and momentum fluxes associated with the Q2DW using the relation _placeholder_formula_ where ρ is density, f is the Coriolis parameter, and R is the gas constant for dry air. The terms _placeholder_formula_ , and _placeholder_formula_ represent zonal mean eddy momentum and heat fluxes (overbars represent zonal means, primes denote deviations from the zonal mean, and brackets denote a daily average). These quantities are computed from gridded 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind, meridional wind, and temperature fields that have been band‐pass filtered in order to isolate the [0.5,3] or [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, as described in . Although numerous modeling studies have examined EP flux‐based diagnostics of the Q2DW, only a few studies have used observations to calculate EP fluxes associated with the Q2DW. For example, Lieberman [ ] used High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) wind and temperature observations from January 1994 to compute EP flux divergences in the SH summer mesosphere. The study by Offermann et al. [ ] used geostrophic winds derived from MLS temperature measurements to relate the occurrence of baroclinically unstable conditions to the intraseasonal variability in the Q2DW observed from ground‐based stations in northern Europe. Similarly, Ern et al. [ ] used wind information derived from SABER temperatures to investigate forcing of the Q2DW by gravity wave activity. Here we use output from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA global HDAS to describe EP flux divergence associated with both [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW in the NH summer. Figure plots EP flux vectors related to the [0.5,3] Q2DW for three cases: 20 July 2007 (Figure a), 16 July 2008 (Figure b), and 23 July 2009 (Figure c). These three cases were chosen based on the large Q2DW amplitudes observed on these dates (see Figure ). Also plotted in Figure is the daily average zonal mean zonal wind distribution for these days, from which we calculate values of _placeholder_formula_ . To illustrate the relationship between baroclinically unstable regions and Q2DW growth, shaded regions in Figure indicate where _placeholder_formula_ is negative. In all three cases, Figure shows EP flux divergence related to the [0.5,3] component of the Q2DW near the core of the easterly jet between 0.05 and 0.1 hPa. The direction of the EP flux vectors indicate propagation of wave activity away from the approximate location of the critical line for the [0.5,3] wave, which is indicated by the bold red contour. In the lower mesosphere the propagation is primarily equatorward, while in the upper mesosphere it is primarily poleward and upward. We note that the regions of high vertical EP flux in Figure coincide with the location of the local maxima in the [0.5,3] temperature amplitudes in Figure . This indicates that the temperature Q2DW near ~75 km and 40°N may be triggered by baroclinic instability near the jet core. We explore this possibility further in section with the use of a linear instability model that uses the NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilated winds and temperatures as input. Figure plots the EP fluxes of the Q2DW for three cases when [0.5,4] amplitudes peaked during the three NH summers: 4 August 2007 (Figure a), 22 June 2008 (Figure b), and 4 July 2009 (Figure c). Wave activity associated with the [0.5,4] component originates just equatorward of the easterly jet core between 0.1 and 0.2 hPa and propagates away from the estimated location of the critical line (blue contour in Figure ), mainly in the upward and poleward direction. It is interesting to note how the locations of the critical lines in Figures and , which are determined by the curvature of the zonal mean zonal wind, can affect the upward propagation of the Q2DW. For example, in the 2007 case (Figure a) the summer easterly jet is weaker and exhibits a poleward tilt with increasing altitude between 40°N and 65°N, which leads to a gradual sloping of the critical lines upward and poleward, away from the source regions. In the 2008 and 2009 cases, the jet is stronger and its core is centered between 40°N and 50°N, producing a “bull‐nose” shape in the location of the critical lines where the equatorward edge of the critical lines extends higher in altitude than in the 2007 case. In particular, the higher extent of the critical lines in the 2009 case (see Figure c and Figure c) appears to direct more Q2DW activity upward into the region above the 0.01 hPa level. To further examine the relationship between the location of the Q2DW critical line and vertical wave propagation during NH summer, Figure plots the time evolution of zonal mean zonal winds over the NH extratropics during July of 2007, 2008, and 2009 at 0.02 hPa. Superimposed upon the wind contours are regions where _placeholder_formula_ is negative (gray shading). Also plotted in Figure are values of the [0.5,3] eddy heat flux (heavy black contours), which are proportional to the vertical component of the EP‐flux (equation ). During July 2007 (Figure a), the location of the [0.5,3] critical line retreats poleward as the month progresses due to the weakening easterly jet. In contrast, the stronger easterly jet during July 2008 and 2009 (Figures b and c) maintains the position of the [0.5,3] critical line near 40°N throughout the month. As a result, there are more sustained periods of high eddy heat flux during July 2008 and 2009. These results indicate that the larger Q2DW amplitudes in July during 2008 and 2009 as compared to July 2007 can be attributed to the characteristics of the summer easterly jet. Specifically, a stronger and more defined jet structure near the Q2DW source region acts to focus more wave activity upward through a smaller area by nature of the critical line's location. A weaker jet, on the other hand, results in the critical line sloping away from the source region that allows upward wave activity to spread throughout a much wider area. Figure summarizes this relationship, plotting time series of the zonal mean zonal winds at 40°N and 0.02 hPa from 15 May to 31 August of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Focusing on the month of July, the zonal mean easterly flow was strongest in 2009, when the [0.5,3] Q2DW amplitudes were largest. During July 2007, when Q2DW amplitudes were smallest, the zonal mean easterlies peaked briefly in early July and remained relatively weak thereafter. The EP‐flux diagnostics based on the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields indicate that the Q2DW originates from baroclinic instabilities near the equatorward flank of the mesospheric summer easterly jet. The interannual variability of the Q2DW amplitudes in NH summer over the 2007–2009 period closely follows interannual variability in the strength and position of the summer easterly jet core, which determines the locations of the critical lines for the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW. As the results in show, both wave number 3 and wave number 4 components of the Q2DW are of comparable magnitude in NH summer, and they both exhibit a high degree of variability throughout the summer season. In the next section, we use a linearized instability model to examine this intraseasonal variability in more detail. Instability Model Results The results in the preceding sections show that both wave number 3 and wave number 4 components of the Q2DW arise from baroclinically unstable regions near the summer easterly jet at midlatitudes in the NH mesosphere. As Figures and illustrate, amplitudes of the [0.5,3] component are typically largest in July, while amplitudes of the [0.5,4] component peak intermittently throughout the period from late June to mid‐August. This variability is consistent with an earlier study of the NH Q2DW by Tunbridge et al. [ ], which showed that in some years the amplitude of the [0.5,4] component surpasses the amplitude of the [0.5,3] component in August. To better understand the origins of this behavior, we use a simple linear instability model to examine the characteristics of the fastest‐growing unstable modes in the MLT region near the NH summer easterly jet. This approach has been used to study other types of free traveling planetary waves in the MLT [e.g., Hartmann , ; Manney and Randel , ]. The model is based on the linearized quasi‐geostrophic potential vorticity equation for frictionless, adiabatic flow on a β ‐plane centered at midlatitudes [see, e.g., Andrews et al. , , equation 3.4.5]: _placeholder_formula_ Here the potential vorticity is derived from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA horizontal wind fields. Formulating the zonal wind and potential vorticity distributions in terms of the geostrophic stream function and assuming periodic solutions as functions of both longitude and time allows equation to be cast as an eigenvalue problem of the form _placeholder_formula_ where x is the state vector represented by gridded values of the stream function and the complex phase speed c is the eigenvalue. The operator A is determined from _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ , the operator B is determined from the finite‐differenced potential vorticity equation; both A and B depend on the zonal wave number. To simplify the calculation, the daily averaged values of NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind fields are subsampled onto the instability model domain, which consists of a uniform grid with 20 points in latitude extending from 20°N to 60° N latitude and 26 points in altitude extending from 65 to 90 km. For a given day, A and B are constructed from the geostrophic stream function and potential vorticity using these subsampled daily averaged zonal winds. Standard numerical codes are then used to solve the eigenvalue problem and obtain x (i.e., the wave modes) and c (i.e., phase speeds) for zonal wave numbers 1 through 6. The fastest growing modes are evaluated in terms of their e ‐folding times, which are determined from the inverse of the imaginary component of the phase speed for each zonal wave number. The periods of the unstable modes are determined from the real component of the phase speed (positive values indicate westward propagation). In addition, each mode's spatial structure contains wind and temperature information from which EP fluxes can be computed. In this discussion, we focus on the summer of 2009 when the Q2DW was most prominent. We first examine model output for two individual cases: 10 July and 5 August. These cases were chosen to highlight the development of the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, respectively, during the NH summer of 2009. Figure a plots the zonal wind and _placeholder_formula_ distributions over the model domain for the 10 July case. We find that zonal wave numbers 3–5 exhibit the fastest growth rates, with e ‐folding times of ~8–9 days (Figure b). The normalized stream function amplitudes of waves 1–4 (Figure c– e) maximize in the region between 30°N and 40°N and 60–70 km, which closely resembles the observed spatial structure of the [0.5,3] temperature Q2DW in Figure . In general, the period of the fastest‐growing modes decreases with increasing horizontal scale. On this particular day, the zonal wave number 3 (Figure e) solution has a period of 2 days, and the wave number 4 solution has a period of 1.5 days. Figure plots instability model results for the 5 August 2009 case. We find that the fastest‐growing modes are again at zonal wave numbers 3–5 (Figure b). However, the e ‐folding times of 3–4 days are much shorter than the July case. The spatial structure of the waves in this case now exhibits two maxima (Figures c– e) centered near 35°N and 45°N. For this August case, the zonal wave number 3 (Figure e) solution has a period of 3.1 days and the wave number 4 solution has a period of 2.3 days. The results from these two cases show that the growth time of the Q2DW decreased by a factor of 2–3 between early July and early August 2009. To determine if this is a systematic effect, the stability model was applied to daily average NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind fields throughout the period from 5 June to 10 August 2009. Figure plots the resulting values of the period and growth time for both wave number 3 and 4 solutions. For plotting purposes, these time series have been smoothed using a three‐point running average. During much of June and early July, both wave numbers have periods near 2 days (Figure a). Starting in mid‐July, the periods increase sharply and then vary in the 3–7 day range thereafter. By late summer, the period of wave number 4 is consistently 1–2 days shorter than wave number 3. The growth time of wave number 4 is shorter than wave number 3 throughout most of the summer (Figure b), and the growth times of wave numbers 3 and 4 both decrease sharply during late July and early August. These calculations have also been performed for the summers of 2007 and 2008, and similar decreases in growth times from July to August were found in each case (not shown). The results from these types of model calculations can be highly sensitive to the curvature of the zonal wind fields, and thus averaging or smoothing of the input dynamical fields can affect the results. We present these calculations to better understand, in a qualitative sense, possible factors that contribute to the observed intraseasonal variability of the NH Q2DW. From these results, we can conclude that the baroclinically unstable region along the equatorward flank of the NH summer easterly jet produces the fastest‐growing modes at wave numbers 3–5. During June and July, the periods of the wave number 3 and 4 modes most closely match the 2 day period of the Rossby normal mode, and these grow preferentially over other modes. These results alone do not explain why the observed [0.5,3] component of the Q2DW is larger during July while the [0.5,4] component is larger in June and August. Nor do they account for the sporadic behavior of the Q2DW which tends to produce the double peaked structure observed in, e.g., Figure . However, based on the observational and model results presented here, we speculate that one possible explanation for this behavior may be that the faster growing wave number 4 unstable mode tends to emerge initially in June, only to be overtaken by the slower growing wave number 3 mode. When the Q2DW amplitudes and associated EP fluxes grow large enough to become unstable and dissipate, they modify the vertical shear structure in the background zonal wind such that it no longer produces fast‐growing unstable modes at zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 with periods near 2 days. This would be consistent with the sudden increase in the period of the unstable wave 3 and wave 4 modes in mid‐July 2009 (Figure a). As baroclinically unstable regions near the easterly jet reform after the Q2DW dissipates, another fast‐growing zonal wave 4 mode can emerge in late July or early August. However, by this time the effects of a weakening easterly jet (Figure ) and increasing tidal amplitudes (Figure ) will combine to limit growth of the slower [0.5,3] mode. Fully interactive GCM simulations are needed to test this hypothesis by studying the origin and growth of these various unstable modes in concert with fluctuations in the strength and curvature of the easterly jet for realistic conditions. Summary and Discussion Global synoptic meteorological analyses of the MLT from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA data assimilation system have provided, for the first time, a comprehensive description of variability in both Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide during the NH summers of 2007–2009. Unlike the SH case, where the Q2DW is primarily a westward propagating zonal wave number 3 feature, we find that the Q2DW in NH summer is composed primarily of westward propagating zonal wave number 3 and wave number 4 components that are comparable in magnitude, consistent with earlier observational studies. The wave number 3 component of the Q2DW typically peaks in July, while the wave number 4 component peaks intermittently throughout the period from late June to mid‐August. We do not find evidence for significant Q2DW activity in the NH extratropics outside of the June–August periods of 2007–2009. Of the three summer periods examined here, the monthly mean wave number 3 Q2DW amplitudes are largest in July 2009 and smallest in July 2007, whereas the amplitudes of the diurnal migrating tide at 30°N are largest in July 2007 and smallest in 2009. Diagnostic calculations based on NOGAPS‐ALPHA output indicate that the Q2DW originates from baroclinically unstable regions on the equatorward flank of the summer easterly jet near the 0.1 hPa level (~65–70 km). The vertical propagation of the Q2DW activity appears to be controlled by the location of the critical line. The large wave number 3 amplitudes observed during July 2009 coincide with a relatively strong and well‐defined easterly jet core that directed more wave activity upward compared to July 2007, when the jet core was smaller and weaker. Results from a linearized instability model using daily NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds for summer 2009 as input show that the baroclinically unstable region near the summer easterly jet supports growth of both zonal wave number 3 and 4 disturbances with periods near 2 days. The growth times of these disturbances are typically in the range of 10–20 days during July, but approach ~5 days in early August. Using a similar modeling approach based on winds from a mechanistic global circulation model (GCM), Rojas and Norton [ ] found evidence for two zonal wave number 3 modes with growth times between 3 and 5 days: a faster growing mode with period of 35 h and a slower growing mode with a period of 42 h. In this study, Rojas and Norton [ ] found that the faster growing mode quickly reached saturation at relatively small amplitude while the slower growing mode continued to grow to much larger amplitude and then began to interact with the background flow. We plan to pursue this subject further by conducting free‐running model simulations using the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields as initial conditions to determine whether the [0.5,3] component interacts with the [0.5,4] components as it grows, or if the two components grow independently from one other. We do not find evidence for Q2DW‐tide interaction that can sometimes lead to rapid amplification of the Q2DW in SH summer [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ; Hecht et al. , ; Chang et al. , ; Yue et al. , ]. This is likely due to the smaller amplitudes and more broad band nature of the Q2DW in NH summer compared to SH summer, which reduces the chances for the type of interaction described by Walterscheid and Vincent [ ]. A modeling study of the SH Q2DW in January by Chang et al. [ ] found that nonlinear advection of momentum by the Q2DW itself may introduce variations in the background flow and, by extension, in tidal amplitudes that can also account for anticorrelation between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide. Other factors controlling the year‐to‐year variations in the strength and location of the NH summer easterly jet such as gravity wave activity [ Ern et al. , ] may also play a role in controlling the behavior of both the Q2DW and tides. To further investigate the nature of possible coupling between the Q2DW, gravity waves, and tides in NH summer, a targeted series of global circulation model (GCM) experiments capable of accurately simulating the evolution of the background zonal flow throughout the NH summer MLT is needed. Recently, Sassi et al. [ ] used a GCM driven by NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields in the lower atmosphere to generate a Q2DW in the SH summer MLT internally through baroclinic instability processes, rather than through means of an imposed forcing [e.g., Chang et al. , ]. A future study will use a similar approach for the NH summer cases of 2007–2009 to more closely examine possible sources of the interseasonal and interannual variability in the NH summer Q2DW presented here.

By 2008 the annual average mixing ratios of these gases in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere had reached 1864 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively. CH 4 has a 100 year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 25 based on an adjustment time (lifetime) of 12 years, whereas N 2 O has a 100 year GWP of 298 and an adjustment time of 114 years [ ]. Globally the principle anthropogenic sources of CH 4 in Tg(CH 4 ) a −1 are agriculture (107–175), waste (35–69), energy (74–77), coal mining (30–46), oil and gas industry (52–68) and biomass and biofuel burning (14–88). For N 2 O the principal global anthropogenic sources, in Tg(N) a −1 , are agriculture (1.7–4.8), industrial processes (0.2–1.8), rivers/coastal waters (0.5–2.9) and biomass burning (0.2–1.0). The values in brackets show the range of emission estimates from various studies as reported by . In NW Europe (Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, hereafter referred to as NWEU), the principle anthropogenic sources of CH 4 in 2006 were reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ( ) to be agriculture (58%), waste (26%) and energy (16%). The natural sources of CH 4 , globally significant through wetland emissions, are thought to be small in comparison to the anthropogenic releases in the NWEU. For N 2 O in 2006, the principle anthropogenic sources in the NWEU as reported to the UNFCCC are agriculture (71%), industrial processes (14%), energy (12%) and waste (3%) and again the natural sources are considered to be small in comparison. The anthropogenic emissions of both gases in the NWEU are covered by the UNFCCC reporting process. Inverse modeling has been used to estimate global and regional surface emissions of CH 4 [ ; ; , ; ; ; ; ] and N 2 O [ ; ; ; ]. Fewer inversion studies have attempted to estimate regional‐ to country‐scale emissions [ ; ]. estimate country, regional and global emissions for three greenhouse gases, HFC‐134a, HFC‐152a and HCFC‐22 for 2005–2007. Their approach uses the FLEXPART Lagrangian model to describe the recent history of the air that reaches nine observation stations globally distributed. They use a priori emission maps and an inversion method that estimates both the baseline and the regional emissions that form part of the global estimates. present a global inversion of CH 4 with a zoom component over Europe for the year 2001. The inversion system uses a priori data and many high‐frequency and weekly observations distributed globally but focused in Europe to estimate annual emissions from the countries in Europe. The results for Germany, France and the United Kingdom suggest the inventories are significantly (50–90%) underreported. Germany has since recalculated its reported emissions for 2001. Subsequent inventory recalculations for the United Kingdom have lead to an increase of 38% for 2001 short of the 93% suggested by . Further recent work by shows they have revised their UK CH 4 estimates downward and they are now much more aligned with the current increased inventory estimates. One of the issues with the 2005 work was the coarse resolution of the computational grid used in the analysis (1°) and this was particularly problematic for the Mace Head station in westerly airflows. As a result the estimated modeled Irish emissions were lower than the reported UNFCCC values and explain to some degree the modeled compensating elevated UK emissions. In the work presented here more than 20 years of high‐frequency, in situ CH 4 and N 2 O observations (1989 to April 2009) from Mace Head, a remote observation station on the west coast of Ireland, have been used. This work follows on from the work presented by , where 5 year estimates of CH 4 and N 2 O were presented for NWEU. A recent paper by confirmed that the Mace Head station is sensitive to emissions in Ireland, the United Kingdom and NW continental Europe, consistent with the region considered in this paper. The observations have been used to estimate, for both gases, the trends in background midlatitude Northern Hemisphere mixing ratios (baseline) and for the more limited period, 1990–2007, the UK and NWEU emissions. These estimates have been compared to those reported to the UNFCCC in 2009 which cover the period 1990–2007. The principle tool used in the analysis of the Mace Head observations is the NAME dispersion model (Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modelling Environment) developed by the UK Met Office [ ; ]. The NAME atmospheric dispersion tool has been used for a diverse range of applications, e.g., air quality [ ; ], emergency response [ ; ] and inversion modeling [ ; ; ; ]. Observations Since 1987, 40 min in situ CH 4 measurements have been made as part of the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) and since 1994 as part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) at Mace Head, Ireland (53.3°N, 9.9°W). CH 4 is measured in air samples with the “AGAGE‐MD” system with gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 5880) and flame ionization detection. Samples are injected at 20 min intervals, with alternate ambient air and standard gas samples, giving a total of 36 calibrated air measurements per day. The calibration scale was established by Tohoku University based on gravimetric preparation of mixtures by Nippon Sanso. A detailed description of this calibration is reported by and . The choice of calibration scale affects the absolute magnitude of the baseline concentrations but has no effect on the inversion results. For much of the time, the measurement station, which is situated on the Atlantic coast, monitors clean westerly air that has traveled across the North Atlantic Ocean (34–51% of the time). However, when the winds are easterly, Mace Head receives substantial regional‐scale pollution in air that has traveled from the industrial regions of Europe (18–35% of the time). The site is therefore uniquely situated to record trace gas mixing ratios associated with both the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere background levels and with the more polluted air arising from Europe. The percentage average annual and monthly contributions from different geographical regions are shown in and , respectively. The definitions of the different categories are given in . No long‐term annual trend in the air mass classifications is discernible. There is a seasonal signal with more “Local” and “Mixed Origin” periods and fewer “European” periods in the summer (May‐September) periods. The sum of “Mixed Origin,” “European” and “Baseline” periods, i.e., those used in the inversion process, shows no annual trend and only a modest seasonal cycle (9% amplitude) with a April‐July minima. NAME Dispersion Model NAME is a Lagrangian particle model that can be driven by stored three‐dimensional meteorological fields from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. In this work two independent sets of meteorology have been used to drive NAME: the Met Office's operational global NWP model, the Unified Model (referred to as UKMO) [ ], and the recently available reanalysis meteorology, ERA Interim (referred to as ERAI) [ ], produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The former is available from 1995 onward to current day and has undergone episodic improvements over the entire period but principally, with resolution upgrades, in 1999, 2002 and 2005. At the time of writing, ERAI meteorology was available from 1989 until 2008. It has the advantage of using a consistent model configuration throughout this time period. The meteorology from both models is a sequence of short‐term forecasts that are produced from successive meteorological analyses. These analysis states use the available meteorological observations (land surface, ocean, satellite, etc.) to constrain the model state to the evolution of the real atmosphere. UKMO has a horizontal resolution of ∼60 km pre‐December 2005 and then ∼40 km onward, the number of vertical levels used by NAME has increased from 11 (1995–1998) to 31 (from December 2005 to June 2009). ERAI is a spectral model with an equivalent horizontal resolution of 0.75° (∼80 km) and NAME uses its lowest 37 vertical levels. NAME was initially developed, more than 20 years ago, as an emergency response tool following the Chernobyl disaster but has since evolved into a general purpose dispersion model covering spatial scales from a few hundred meters to global scales. The model air parcels move in a three‐dimensional space driven by either three‐dimensional NWP meteorology or single‐site observations. A random walk technique is used to simulate atmospheric turbulence. In the boundary layer, profiles of turbulence are estimated [ ], these converge at the top of the boundary layer to a small value in the free troposphere with a fixed standard deviation ( σ u = 0.25 m s −1 and σ w = 0.1 m s −1 ). In the work presented here the model schemes for representing chemistry, dry deposition, wet deposition and radioactive decay were not used, i.e., the gases were considered to be inert tracers, which, given their long respective atmospheric lifetimes and the fact the model domain was limited to the European/North Atlantic region was considered to be appropriate. The most significant loss process to consider here is OH oxidation of methane, however, over a 12 d period, with typical OH levels, the depletion in methane from OH oxidation amounts to ∼0.7%. Even with ten times the amount of OH, such as would be seen in a strong photochemical ozone episode, the depletion would only be 7%. This is trivial in comparison with the other uncertainties. The depletions from surface uptake of methane would be even smaller than from OH depletion. The boundary layer depth (BLD) estimates are taken from the driving NWP meteorological model except for pre‐August 2002 UKMO (unavailable). Pre‐August 2002, NAME directly estimates the BLD as described by . The minimum BLD allowed within NAME was set to 100 m to be consistent with the maximum emission height and the height of the output grid. The impact of using different BLD estimates is further discussed in . The NAME model is run in backward mode to estimate the recent history (12 d) of the air en route to Mace Head. An air history map, such as those shown in , has been calculated for each 3 h period from 1995 until June 2009 using UKMO and from 1989 to 2008 using ERAI, amounting to more than 90,000 maps. The model output estimates the 12 d time‐integrated air concentration (dosage) at each grid box (fixed at 40 km horizontal resolution and 0–100 m above ground level irrespective of meteorology used) from a release of 1 g s −1 at Mace Head (the receptor). The model is three‐dimensional therefore it is not just surface to surface transport that is modeled. An air parcel can travel from the surface to a high altitude and then back to the surface but only those times when the air parcel is within the lowest 100 m above the ground will it be recorded in the maps. The computational domain covers 100.0°W to 45.125°E longitude and 10.0°N to 80.125°N latitude and extends to more than 10 km vertically. For each 3 h period 33,000 inert model particles were used to describe the dispersion, increasing the number of particles has been shown to have negligible impact on the noise within the inversion domain. By dividing the dosage [g s m −3 ] by the total mass emitted [3600 s h −1 × 3 h × 1 g s −1 ] and multiplying by the geographical area of each grid box [m 2 ], the model output is converted into a dilution matrix D [s m −1 ]. Each element of this matrix D dilutes a continuous emission ( ) of 1 g m −2 s −1 from a given grid box over the previous 12 d to an air concentration [g m −3 ] at the receptor ( ) during a 3 h period (). _placeholder_formula_ Running the model backward in this way, compared to a forward simulation, is very computationally efficient as every modeled particle has a direct impact on the solution. However, it should be noted that backward running is only a very close approximation to running forward, it is not exactly reversible. Baseline Concentration Analysis Baseline concentrations are defined as those that have not been influenced by significant emissions within the previous 12 d of travel en route to Mace Head, i.e., those that are well mixed and are representative of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere background concentrations. The observations at Mace Head from 1989 to June 2009 have been analyzed for each gas measured. The analysis considers the long‐term trend of the monthly and annual baseline mixing ratios, their rate of growth and their seasonal cycle. Defining Baseline Observations A 3 h period is classed as “baseline” if it meets certain criteria with respect to a dilution sensitivity limit. The dilution sensitivity limit is attempting to define a threshold above which an emission source would generate a concentration at Mace Head that would be discernible above the baseline noise. As this limit is based on the NAME dilution calculations it is independent of the gas species and therefore the same limit value can be used for both of the gases analyzed. The criteria are: 1. The total air concentration from the nine grid boxes centered on and surrounding Mace Head is less than ten times the dilution sensitivity limit, i.e., local emissions do not significantly contribute. 2. The total air concentration contribution from the European landmass is less than five times the dilution sensitivity limit, i.e., European emissions do not significantly contribute. 3. The contribution from the southerly latitudes is less than twice the dilution sensitivity limit indicating that southerly latitude air, with a different baseline concentration, is not significantly present. For both gases there is a strong hemispheric gradient because of disproportionately higher emissions in the Northern Hemisphere. In previous work the noise in the CH 4 observations classed as baseline was ∼10 ppb. For a CH 4 emission to be discernible at Mace Head, its impact there must be >∼10 ppb. In this work we have arbitrarily chosen 100 kt CH 4 a −1 gridbox −1 (∼4% of the total UK CH 4 emission) to be the minimum discernible emission, this equates to emissions of ∼2 μ g m −2 s −1 , 0.5 μ g m −2 s −1 and 0.125 μ g m −2 s −1 at 40 km, 80 km and 160 km grid box resolution, respectively, and delivers a dilution sensitivity limit of 3.4 s m −1 . Choosing a larger (smaller) minimum discernible emission reduces (increases) the dilution sensitivity limit and thus increases (decreases) the resolution of the gridded output, but will reduce (increase) the emission sensitivity of the grid boxes. The chosen limit is arbitrary but sensitivity analysis, discussed in , shows that the impact of this choice is small. shows a 3 month extract of the CH 4 observations measured at Mace Head. The observations have been color coded to indicate whether, using the above classification, the air mass they were sampled from was considered baseline. For this baseline analysis all nonbaseline observations are removed. Removing Outliers and Smoothing the Baseline The points defined as baseline using the above methodology still have a certain level of noise. The principle reasons for this are: emissions from the populated regions of the USA and Canada; unexpected emissions (for instance, forest fires in Canada or shipping); local emissions that are not identified using the above criteria; incorrectly modeled meteorology or transport (i.e., European air defined as baseline by error). Irrespective of the methodology used to identify these events some will inevitably be classed as baseline when it is inappropriate to do so. To capture such events the baseline data are statistically filtered, within a moving 40 d window, to isolate and remove these outliers that are actually nonbaseline observations. The observations removed through applying this statistical filter are shown in green in . For each hour in the time series the remaining baseline points in a running 40 d window are fitted using a quadratic function and the value extracted for the current hour in question. The process is then advanced by an hour and repeated. Finally, the baseline time series is smoothed using the median value within a moving 20 d time window. The choice of the length of the time windows and number of points is arbitrary. It is a balance between using sufficient baseline points while still capturing the seasonal signal. Modest (±50%) changes to these values have little impact on the resulting baseline concentration. Baseline Noise The noise or potential error in the smoothed baseline mixing ratio is estimated to be the standard deviation of the difference between the observations classed as baseline and the smoothed baseline mixing ratios at the corresponding times. shows, on a much expanded y axis compared to , the typical spread of baseline observations about the smoothed continuous baseline estimate. For CH 4 the baseline noise over 1989–2008 using ERAI is 8.7 ppb (assuming average 1860 ppb baseline for CH 4 this is 0.47%) and over 1995–2009 using UKMO is 8.3 ppb (0.45%), the values for N 2 O are 0.25 ppb (0.08% assuming average baseline of 320 ppb) and 0.19 ppb (0.06%), respectively. If the same period (1995–2008) is analyzed, the noise values for ERAI and UKMO are closer still, with a 0.3 ppb difference for CH 4 and a 0.002 ppb difference for N 2 O. This shows the reduction in magnitude from using ERAI over the entire period 1989–2008 to using UKMO is partially a result of the improved accuracy of the observations from 1994 onward rather than because of the different meteorology. Baseline Analysis Monthly baseline mixing ratios are estimated by averaging all of the hourly baseline values within the appropriate time window. A monthly value is estimated provided hourly values span at least two thirds of the month, this ensures the value is representative of the baseline concentration across the whole month. Using this methodology all months, from February 1989, are assigned baseline mixing ratios. The baseline analysis has been conducted with both sets of meteorology. The differences in the estimated monthly baseline mixing ratios are small, the mean difference in monthly baseline for CH 4 is 0.1 ppb ( σ = 0.93 ppb) and for N 2 O is 0.01 ppb ( σ = 0.01 ppb), in both cases the baseline derived using ERAI is, on average, marginally higher. The monthly baseline mixing ratios from both analyses are shown in . As a sensitivity test, the impact of adding 50% to the dilution sensitivity limit was investigated using the ERAI. The mean difference in the monthly baseline using the two different limit values was found to be negligible, 0.1 ppb ( σ = 1.1 ppb) for CH 4 and 0.01 ppb ( σ = 0.02 ppb) for N 2 O. This is comparable to the difference because of the choice of meteorology. The annual growth rate on a particular day is defined as the current daily baseline value minus the previous year's value on the same day, e.g., growth rate for 14 January 1996 = (daily baseline for 14 January 1996) – (daily baseline for 14 January 1995). By averaging the annual growth rate values (one per day) within a running 12 month period (6 months either side of the day), a smoothed annual growth rate per day is estimated. Monthly averages of these growth rates are shown in . Over the 20 year period the average CH 4 growth rate is 3.9 ppb a −1 but with significant variability year to year (peaks in 1991, 1998–1999, 2003, 2007–2008). The N 2 O growth rate has been much more consistent at 0.7 ppb a −1 but still with variability, with peaks in 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007–2008 and troughs in between. To illustrate the seasonal cycles of CH 4 and N 2 O, the monthly baseline mixing ratios are detrended and presented in for the baseline derived from ERAI. The spread shows the extent of the year to year variability. CH 4 has a peak mixing ratio in February‐April (+9 ppb) and a minimum in July (−18 ppb). A similar cycle is shown for N 2 O, peak in March‐April (+0.26 ppb) and trough in August (−0.41 ppb). However, the reasons for these seasonal cycles are different. For CH 4 , it is the loss through OH chemistry that drives the cycle with OH production at a maximum in August. For N 2 O, the seasonal cycle is due to the seasonality in; surface sources, transport between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and transport of N 2 O‐poor air from the stratosphere to the troposphere. The observed summertime minimum in tropospheric N 2 O in the Northern Hemisphere is reported to result from the propagation of springtime lower stratospheric minima down to the troposphere with a ∼4 month lag time [ ; ; ]. Regional Emission Estimates By removing the time‐varying baseline mixing ratios from the raw observation data, a time series of excursions from the baseline for each observed gas has been generated (1995–2009 using UKMO and 1989–2008 using ERAI). The observed deviations from baseline are averaged over each 3 h period. Negative perturbations are set to zero. For CH 4 (N 2 O), the average percentage of negative perturbations per year was 38% (35%), but the values were generally small, median = −5.9 ppb (−0.1 ppb), and below the noise in the baseline estimate, 8.7 ppb (0.25 ppb). Because of the way the baseline is constructed, it is not surprising that around half of the baseline observations (∼45% of observations, see ) lead to small negative perturbations. These observed deviations are assumed to be driven by emissions on regional scales that have yet to be fully mixed on the hemisphere scale. Henceforth these baseline‐removed observations are referred to as simply the observations. shows the number of observations per year classed as European that are above 200 ppb for CH 4 and above 4.5 ppb for N 2 O. Over the 20 year period the number of events for N 2 O has declined (linear regression: −0.14 a −1 ) but a similar trend is not seen in the CH 4 observations (−0.01 a −1 ). From this basic analysis it would tentatively suggest that the regional N 2 O emissions have declined over time, or at least some significant sources have been removed, whereas the regional CH 4 emissions have seen no observable change in their frequency. Inversion Methodology The observation time series, together with the NAME model output predicting the recent history of the air, were used to estimate the emission distribution of each gas over NWEU. The iterative best fit technique, simulated annealing [ ], was used to derive these regional emission estimates based on a statistical skill score (cost function) comparing the observed and modeled time series at Mace Head. The technique starts from a set of randomly generated emission maps, it then searches for the emission map that leads to a modeled time series at Mace Head that most accurately mimics the observations. The aim of the inversion method is to estimate the spatial distribution of emissions across a defined geographical area ( e ) using . The emissions are assumed to be constant in time over the analysis period. The observations are converted from volume mixing ratio [ppb] to air concentration [g m −3 ] using the modeled temperature and pressure at the observation point. Inversion Domain and Grid Resolution The inversion domain is chosen to be a smaller subset of the full domain used for the air history maps. It covers 30°W–42°E longitude and 29.3°N–77.3°N latitude and is shown as the black box in . The smaller domain covers all of Europe and extends a reasonable distance into the Atlantic. The inversion domain needs to be smaller to ensure recirculating air masses are fully represented but also because emission sources very distant from Mace Head have little discernible impact on the concentration at the station, i.e., the signal would be too weak to be seen. The inversion method assumes baseline concentration air enters the inversion domain regardless of direction. For the eastern and southern edges in particular this assumption will be incorrect. Emissions in Russia and around the Black Sea would be expected to elevate the atmospheric concentrations along the eastern edge, and because of the latitudinal gradient it would be reasonable to assume below midlatitudinal baseline concentration air enters from the south. This issue is overcome in the inversion by solving for but not analyzing the estimated emissions in any grid box on the edge of the inversion domain. It is assumed that the error of above or below baseline concentration air entering the domain will be absorbed into the solutions in these edge grid boxes. This assumption has been tested by comparing the solutions for the United Kingdom with this domain to those obtained when a significantly larger inversion domain is used. The results of this comparison are discussed in . In order for the best fit algorithm to provide robust solutions for every area within the domain, each region needs to significantly contribute to the air concentration at Mace Head on a reasonable number of time periods. If the signal from an area is only rarely or poorly seen at Mace Head, then its impact on the cost function is minimal and the inversion method has little skill at determining its true emission. The contribution that different grid boxes make to the air concentration observed varies from grid box to grid box. Grid boxes that are distant from the observation site contribute relatively little to the observation, whereas those that are close can have a large impact. In order to balance the contribution from different grid boxes, those that are more distant are grouped together into increasingly larger blocks. The grouping varies for each time period considered and between the different gases because of varying meteorology and the impact of missing observations, respectively. The underlying horizontal grid resolution is 40 km (= x ), which is equal to the resolution of the NAME output. The grouping creates blocks that have a resolution of x , 2 x , 4 x , 8 x , 16 x and 32x. An emission sensitivity level [g m −2 s −1 ] has been estimated for each gas. Below this level the impact of the emission at the receptor is assumed lost within the baseline noise of the observation. The dilution sensitivity limit threshold (3.4 s m −1 ), as derived in the baseline analysis, is used again. Baseline noise is defined as the standard deviation of baseline observations about the defined smoothed baseline value, as discussed in . The values are 8.7 ppb (6 μ g m −3 ) for CH 4 and 0.25 ppb (0.48 μ g m −3 ) for N 2 O using ERAI at standard temperature and pressure. The emission sensitivity for CH 4 is thus defined to be 1.8 μ g m −2 s −1 (∼90 kt a −1 for a 40 km grid box) and for N 2 O to be 0.14 μ g m −2 s −1 (∼7 kt a −1 for a 40 km grid box). For each grid box the number of times it provides a contribution to Mace Head above the dilution sensitivity limit threshold is calculated from the dilution matrix. If this is below the minimum number required (arbitrarily defined as 240 3 h time periods, i.e., 30 d) within the 3 year period, then a grid resolution twice as coarse is considered. This process is repeated until the condition is satisfied or until the grid resolution is 32 times the original (32 x ) ( ), where x = ∼40 km. Inversion Process The modeled time series at the measurement station is calculated by applying the current hypothesized emission map to the dilution matrix (). The inversion process works by iteratively choosing different emissions, varying the emission magnitudes and distributions, with the aim of minimizing the mismatch between the observations and the modeled concentrations. No a priori conditions are set, with the exception that no emissions are allowed to be negative. The relative skill of a derived emission map is tested by comparing the modeled and observed time series by using a cost function that combines four different statistics. Other cost functions were investigated, for example; root mean square error, varying the weights applied to the different statistics; and, removing one of the four statistics, using the pseudo data experiment (see ) but were found to be less accurate at recreating a prescribed (known) emission distribution. _placeholder_formula_ where r = Pearson correlation coefficient NMSE = Normalized Mean Square Error: fac2 = Fraction within a factor of 2 of observations facNoise = Fraction of model values within Noise of the observations Noise = Standard deviation of baseline observations about the defined smoothed baseline value. Note observations below the Noise level are considered to have a magnitude equal to the Noise level with respect to the fac2 calculation. The iteration process is repeated until any potential improvement in skill in the emission map is estimated to be negligible. To simulate uncertainties in the meteorology, dispersion and observations a time series of random noise is applied to the observations. The random element is multiplicative and taken from a lognormal distribution with mean one and variance, arbitrarily, set to one fifth of the Noise . Any observations that are negative are considered to be zero. For each time period solved for, the whole inversion process is repeated multiple times (arbitrarily set to 52) to give a robust indication of the potential uncertainty in the emission solution, each time with a different random starting point and a different time series of random noise. Solutions are calculated for 3 year periods covering the period when observations are available. After solutions have been estimated for a particular 3 year period, the period is moved forward by 1 month and the process repeated, e.g., January 1995 to December 1997, February 1995 to January 1998. An annual estimate of emissions is calculated by averaging all of the solutions that contain a complete calendar year (1300 solutions) within the solved‐for time period. The range for each year for each geographical region is calculated from the same sample of 1300 solutions and is taken as the 5th and 95th percentile. Observations Used in the Inversion Any periods that were classed as baseline but were removed by the statistical filtering are removed from the analysis as these are considered to be unrepresentative of air from that sector. Times when the air is classed as “local” are likewise removed from the analysis. A 3 h period is classed as local if the contribution from the 9 grid boxes surrounding Mace Head is above fifteen times the dilution sensitivity limit. The local times represent periods when the emissions from the local area (120 km × 120 km area centered on Mace Head) would have a dominant effect on the observations. These are typically characterized by low wind speeds, low boundary layer heights and thus poor dispersion conditions. During such times the meteorological models used, with horizontal resolutions of between 40 and 80 km, are poor at resolving the local flows as they are dominated by subgrid scale processes, e.g., land‐sea breezes. In all 86% (87%) of the CH 4 (N 2 O) observations were retained for analysis using ERAI. A similar percentage is retained when using UKMO. Pseudo Data Experiment To assess the ability of the inversion system to estimate correctly emissions on the regional scale, it was first applied to model derived pseudo observations. The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) ( ) were used to calculate a model time series at Mace Head. Time series were derived using both ERAI and UKMO. The inversion system was tested using the ERAI dilution matrix applied to, first, the pseudo observations derived using ERAI and then to the pseudo observations derived using UKMO. The latter test investigates the ability of the inversion system to estimate emissions with a system that has errors. The impact of applying random noise to the system is investigated by solving with and without noise. shows the time series of emission estimates and true emissions for NWEU in this idealized case study. The agreement between the median emission total and truth when no noise is added to the pseudo observations is excellent and the uncertainty bars are small. When noise is added to the measurements the median fit is still good but the uncertainty range is larger (solid lines). When a different meteorology is used to derive the pseudo observations and noise is added (dashed line) the fit is still good but the uncertainty range is at its largest. However, in every case the uncertainty range completely encompasses the true solution and gives confidence that the methodology is able to recreate the correct emission total within the estimated uncertainty range. Results is an example of the observed and modeled time series of the air mixing ratio for CH 4 for the first 3 months of 2006 at Mace Head. The modeled time series (gray) is a composite of all of the inversion solutions that cover this 3 month period. The magnitudes and patterns are similar and demonstrate that the inversion process is able to derive an emission map that produces a good match to the observations. shows the average (minimum and maximum) statistical fit between the observed and modeled time series at Mace Head for each year. and show examples of the average inversion emission maps for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively, for January 1990 to December 1992 ( , left, and , left) and January 2006 to December 2008 ( , right, and , right). The vast majority of the estimated emissions are land‐based as expected, although for N 2 O, there are significant emissions estimated in the North Sea. The application of fertilizer onto crops can leach into rivers and thereby reach the sea, therefore, it is entirely plausible that a reasonable amount of N 2 O could be released from the sea rather than the land. The relatively large‐sized grid boxes on the east of the United Kingdom also, in effect, smudge emissions over sea areas. This is why the geographical areas used to define UK and NWEU emissions extend out into the North Sea ( ). Emission totals from specific geographical areas are calculated by summing the emissions from each 40 km grid box in that region ( ). Emission estimates for N 2 O for the United Kingdom using both sets of meteorology are presented in time series graphs and compared to the reported UNFCCC values ( ). Similar graphs ( ) are shown for NW Europe with the United Kingdom removed (NWEU‐noUK). and show emission time series graphs for CH 4 . The NAME inversion annual emission estimates with uncertainties for the United Kingdom using ERAI for N 2 O and CH 4 are given in and , respectively, and are compared to the UNFCCC inventory estimates. Sensitivities and Uncertainties in the Inversion Methodology There is no absolute method of defining the uncertainties associated with these best fit estimates. They occur because of errors in the inversion process, in the input meteorology, in the transport modeling in NAME and in the observations. This section discusses the sensitivities of the inversion results to (1) choice of meteorology, (2) domain size, and (3) a bias in the baseline concentration, and discusses other areas of potential uncertainty and how these have been minimized. The NAME inversion results using ERAI and UKMO are presented ( – ). Although there are differences, within the uncertainty ranges there is good agreement between the solutions using different meteorologies. For CH 4 , the differences are all within the 25th–75th uncertainty range. For N 2 O there is a fairly consistent difference up until 2005, but always within the 5th–95th uncertainty range. In the early years of the comparison the UKMO results are lower than the ERAI results, in the latter years the reverse is the case. The reasons for this reversal are linked to the definition of the boundary layer height in the two models and how these have evolved over the years within the UKMO. compares the average monthly BLD modeled at Mace Head by the two meteorologies. The UKMO estimated BLD at Mace Head is on average lower than the ERAI estimated BLD however over the years the average difference between the two estimates has narrowed considerably. If this is generally the case over the whole domain the model with the lower BLD will enhance the modeled surface concentration for a given surface emission. This would then lead the inversions using UKMO to require lower emissions to model a given surface concentration and hence potentially explain some of the differences between the emission estimates using the two meteorologies. The periodic upgrades to the UKMO have meant that the location of the Mace Head station with respect to the meteorological grid has varied over the years which will mean that the amount of land to sea within the grid box will have changed and will alter the BLD estimates interpolated to the Mace Head station. Therefore without further analysis it is not possible to be definitive about the impact of the results shown in . The inversion method assumes that only baseline concentration air enters the domain. This does not always hold true. It is assumed that above (below) baseline air entering the domain will lead to elevated (depressed) emission estimates only at the edge of the domain. Therefore the inversion domain solved for is significantly larger than the NWEU domain and it is assumed that the majority of these edge effects will not impact on the analysis of NWEU and UK emission totals. and show the sensitivity of the NAME inversion UK estimates to a systematic bias in the baseline estimate, both positive and negative, and to using a larger domain for the inversion calculation. The baseline mixing ratio was first increased and then decreased by one standard deviation ( σ ) of the baseline noise. Each 3 year period (within 1989–2008) using ERAI was solved three times with no additional noise and the median annual estimate calculated as before. The red dash‐dot line shows the impact of lowering the baseline and the red dashed line the impact of increasing the baseline. The estimates as presented in and are also shown for comparison. For CH 4 the changes in the baseline are comfortably within the 25–75th percentile uncertainty ranges, showing that a bias of this magnitude is captured by the uncertainty analysis. For N 2 O the addition or subtraction of a bias in the baseline has an impact that is sometimes larger than the 5–95th percentile uncertainty ranges. Therefore the N 2 O totals are susceptible to a bias in the baseline mixing ratio and this could lead to an increase of up to 30% in the UK uncertainty estimates. The colored lines in and show the impact of increasing the domain (blue lines) as well as having a bias in the baseline mixing ratio (dashed and dash‐dot blue lines). The results are similar to those when the standard domain is used (black) and demonstrate that the inversion solution is largely insensitive to the domain size chosen. For N 2 O the impact is to generally lower (on average by 10%) the UK estimates, there is no impact for CH 4 outside the uncertainty ranges already presented. All of the emissions are assumed constant in time within a given 3 year period and are geographically static. This is clearly a significant simplification. A sudden, but subsequently maintained, change in emissions will be picked up by solving multiple 3 year periods covering slightly different time periods, i.e., solving for a 3 year period and then advancing by 1 month. Enhanced emissions in any particular season, e.g., increased N 2 O emissions in spring following fertilizer application, will not be resolved. Intermittent or sporadic emissions will be averaged and their “true” contribution maybe lost. All areas of the domain are assumed to impact reasonably equally on Mace Head given the dispersion and transport processes modeled by NAME. The grouping of grid boxes together, so that each area contributes approximately equally to the observations, attempts to ensure this but clearly there will be some variability. Also large grid boxes could have significant variability actually within the grid box itself especially if there are significant orographic features within the grid box, e.g., the Alps, or land‐sea boundaries. This may lead to errors if certain parts of the grid box are more frequently sampled than others. However, because of the large travel distances and therefore time elapsed between emission in these large grid boxes and measurement at Mace Head the impact of this will be small. Also by only reporting emissions within NWEU this issue is considered to be small. The inversion method makes no distinction between anthropogenic and natural sources and thus its estimates are for the combined total, making direct comparisons with the UNFCCC inventory difficult. From other studies the natural emissions in NWEU are estimated to be small in comparison to the anthropogenic emissions. For CH 4 the natural emissions in NWEU are estimated to be 240 kt a −1 [ ], less than 10% of the total emission. It is also important to recognize that the atmospheric release of N 2 O from agricultural practices, such as nitrogen fertilizer application, may occur at some considerable distances from the point of application because of transportation by rivers. This adds to the uncertainty of using the maps to attribute emissions to particular regions. The area considered to be the United Kingdom includes the waters directly surrounding the United Kingdom ( ) and so the impact of this is considered to be small for the United Kingdom. This would be problematic if the individual contributions of Belgium or The Netherlands for example were presented and is the reason why only the NWEU total is considered. The most significant region in relation to this issue is the border between Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland, however because of the proximity to Mace Head and the corresponding high resolution of the output in that area, the impact is small. The transport modeling and thus the inversion algorithm also assume that the loss processes associated with each gas are negligible within the regional domain. Given the atmospheric lifetimes of both of the gases studied here, 8.7 years (CH 4 ) and 114 years (N 2 O) [ ], this is considered to be a robust assumption. Discussion Considering the N 2 O results, and show the inventory and inversion estimates for the United Kingdom throughout the whole 18 year period. The inventory estimates are reported to have an uncertainty of 252% ( , UK National Inventory Report, 2010) and estimate there is a 95% probability the UK N 2 O emissions in 2008 were between 33% and 73% below the level in 1990. The inversion results are consistently lower than the inventory estimates (20–50 kt a −1 ). However, the trend comparison is excellent, the inversion results estimate there is a 95% probability that the UK emissions in 2007 are between 34% and 70% below the level in 1990, and are estimated to have fallen by 5.1 kt a −1 compared to the inventory rate of fall of 5.8 kt a −1 . The step change in the emission total in 1999 appears in both estimates although smoothed in the inversion estimates because of the 3 year averaging period. In the inventory this step is related to the application of an abatement technology at an adipic acid plant in the northeast of England, a similar technology was also fitted to an adipic acid plant in Germany in 1997. The agreement between the inversion estimates and the inventory would imply that the reported reduction in emissions because of the new UK technology was achieved. The results for NWEU with the United Kingdom removed (NWEU‐noUK) ( ) show the inversion estimates are again consistently lower than the inventory estimates (60–240 kt a −1 ). Both estimates show an overall reduction in emissions, but the inversion results show a significant rise in emissions over the period 1990–1995 that is not seen in the inventory. The results for CH 4 for the United Kingdom ( and ) show a more significant difference. The NAME inversion estimates show a modest decline 1990–1993 but since have remained approximately constant, within the uncertainty ranges. The NAME inversion UK emissions in 2007 are estimated to be 41% (median) below the level in 1990, but with a very large spread (25th to 75th percentile range is 16% to 60%, and the 95% probability range is 83% below to 78% above). The UNFCCC inventory estimates are reported to have an uncertainty of 23% ( , UK National Inventory Report, 2010), estimate there is a 95% probability the UK CH 4 emissions in 2008 were between 50% and 56% below the level in 1990 and show a marked and monotonic decline over the whole period. There is a significant difference in the trend in the emission estimates, the UNFCCC inventory estimates have decreased by 170 kt a −1 compared to a modest decrease of 22 kt a −1 in the NAME inversion estimates. The agreement over the period 2000–2008 is good, the inventory estimates are within the 25th–75th NAME inversion uncertainty range for each year. The estimates for NWEU‐noUK show reasonable agreement across the whole 20 years. The median NWEU‐noUK results are higher (380–3770 kt a −1 ) than the UNFCCC estimates but the overall trend agreement is good. It is possible that in the inversion estimates some of the actual UK emissions are incorrectly assigned to a grid box outside of the UK domain ( ) and highlights the challenge of estimating emissions from just one site. A similar site, or sites, on the east coast of the United Kingdom would enable a much clearer distinction between UK and non‐UK sources. This may partially explain the rise in the NWEU‐noUK total in 1991–1993 and the corresponding dip in the UK total in the same years. It is also notable that the uncertainty ranges for CH 4 are significantly larger than those for N 2 O reflecting the larger baseline noise for CH 4 . The inversion results are consistent with the initial and crude analysis of the observations ( ), i.e., a relatively flat UK CH 4 emission trend and a declining emission trend for UK N 2 O. The comparison in the trend in emissions for the United Kingdom for CH 4 and N 2 O are strikingly different. However, for both gases the inversion methodology was identical. Also because the agreement with the independent NOAA observational record for both gases at Mace Head has shown strong consistency over the entire period, it is unlikely that the comparisons are significantly affected by a difference in the accuracy of the observations. Other possible explanations could be a significant difference in their respective emission distributions or the relative impact of emission intermittency. However, both gases are primarily released from diffuse sources, e.g., agriculture, landfill. The intermittency of significant N 2 O emissions following fertilizer application will certainly impact on the observations and hence the inversion results and it is difficult to directly quantify this affect. The long (3 year) inversion periods have been chosen to minimize this impact. The UK UNFCCC CH 4 estimates show a significant decline (2364 kt) between 1990 and 2003. This is dominated by a reduction of emissions from solid waste disposal on land (landfill) of 1320 kt (waste sector) and from fugitive emissions from solid fuel (coal mining) of 610 kt (energy sector). These two source categories account for 82% of the reduction in the reported emissions. The reduction in the median UK CH 4 inversion estimates between 1990 and 2003 amount to 780 kt, albeit with significant uncertainty, a third of the reduction declared to the UNFCCC. Therefore the difference in the reduction in UK CH 4 emissions between the two methods is 1590 kt. It is important to understand the reason for this mismatch in the UK CH 4 estimates. Could a significant proportion (66%) of the reported emission reduction in the UK landfill and coal mining have already been achieved by 1990? This would fit with the inversion estimates. Or could the reduction in the emissions from landfill and coal mining have been partially compensated for by an increase in a different unreported source(s)? This is unlikely because these significant emissions would still have to be present today and would not fit with the present‐day good match between the two emission estimates. Was the reduction in landfill emissions not achieved? This could be either that the landfill emission reduction methods were not as effective or that the landfill were not emitting as much as estimated in the early 1990s. The former would imply that the current inventory is still underreporting which is not supported by the inversion estimates. The latter explanation would be more consistent with the inversion results and support the argument that pre‐1990 emission reductions in waste/coal were more effective than estimated in the inventory. The magnitude of the difference between the inventory and the inversion estimates is more than twice the reduction reported for coal mining alone hence it is unlikely that this is the main reason for the difference although it could be a significant contributing factor if it was in error. Another possibility is that the UK CH 4 inversion estimates and more importantly the emission trend is significantly in error. However, the same methodology was applied equally to CH 4 and to N 2 O so it is unlikely that only one of the trends is correct. The meteorology used was consistent throughout the time period so this is unlikely to be the cause of an error in the trend. The measurement instrument was changed in February 1994 but the difference between the inventory and inversion results were at their peak in 1993–1995 and remained very significant (outside 75th percentile range) until 2000 and so this is unlikely to be a significant cause for the mismatch. Other inversion estimates for the United Kingdom for 2001 [ ] show higher UK emissions (4200 kt a −1 ) than found in this study. However, more recent work by this group [ ] revised their emissions for the United Kingdom down to a value more consistent with both this study and the current inventory value for 2001. All of these estimates were performed using data from just one measurement station on the west coast of Ireland. The inversion estimates would be improved if more stations, each making comparable quality observations, were included in the analysis. Not only would this add more data, but crucially, enable a better distinction between the United Kingdom and Continental European emissions, especially if some of the additional sites were on the east coast of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately additional observations at other stations in Europe were only started, at the earliest, in the late 1990s. Including other stations midway through the analysis period would undermine the consistent approach used throughout the time series in this study, but would be a worthy exercise to undertake in future work. Conclusions This paper describes a method for estimating the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere baseline mixing ratio from observations recorded at the remote Mace Head, Ireland measurement station. The baseline trends of CH 4 and N 2 O from 1989 until 2009 are presented. They show that the abundance of N 2 O has consistently increased in the atmosphere with an average growth of 0.7 ppb a −1 . The CH 4 mixing ratio has risen overall and an average growth rate of 3.9 ppb a −1 is reported. However, with both gases there is significant year‐to‐year variability in the growth rates, with CH 4 having seen several periods of negative growth. Both gases have significant seasonal cycles with sharp summer minima and broad spring maxima. The CH 4 minimum and maximum occur a month earlier than that seen in the N 2 O record. An inversion method is described that is shown to accurately reproduce regional emission totals given, so‐called, modeled pseudo observations, even when an independent meteorology is used. Annual inversion emission estimates for the United Kingdom and NWEU (United Kingdom removed) for CH 4 and N 2 O are presented for each year, 1990–2007, using, where available, two different meteorological data sets. The comparison between the estimates derived using both meteorologies is good and the results using UKMO consistently fall within the estimated uncertainty ranges of the ERAI results. The inversion results have been compared to the country values reported to the UNFCCC process. The results indicate reasonable agreement for the United Kingdom for N 2 O over the entire period. The median inversion estimates are on average 22% lower than the inventory estimates. For CH 4 for the United Kingdom the median NAME inversion estimates show a decline of 24% in emissions from the 3 year period 1990–1992 to the period 2005–2007, compared to a drop of over 50% in the reported inventory values. The uncertainties in both methods are significant but the different trends are striking. The agreement in the trend for NW Europe (United Kingdom removed) for both gases is reasonable, on average the inversion results for N 2 O are 25% lower than inventory estimates and for CH 4 21% higher. The drop in the UK CH 4 inventory values is reported to be dominated by a reduction in landfill and, to a lesser extent, coal mine emissions. The UK CH 4 estimates agree, within the 25th–75th percentile model uncertainties, from 2000 onward. The agreement of the N 2 O estimates and the later agreement of the CH 4 estimates points to the inversion methodology being capable of estimating UK emissions. It would suggest that the landfill and maybe the coal mine emissions in the early 1990s may have been overestimated in the reported inventory values. This is particularly relevant as 1990 is used as the base year on which to calculate UK reductions in emissions to comply with the UK Kyoto commitments, set at 12.5% within the compliance period 2008–2012. If the median UK inversion estimates for 1990 and 2007 for N 2 O and CH 4 are used to replace the inventory values in calculating the total GHG reduction in emissions from 1990 then the United Kingdom has achieved a drop of 14.3% by 2007 compared to the reported value of 17.3%. Therefore the United Kingdom would still have complied with its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol but, if the NAME inversion estimates are assumed, by a smaller margin.

Typically, the SSA particles contain ∼55% of Cl, 30% of Na, 8% of sulphates, and other components in smaller fractions. SSA particles may also be enriched with organic material [ ; ; ; ]. SSA affects the Earth radiation budget, atmospheric chemistry, cloud processes, and climate [ ; ]. The mass concentration of SSA and its associated light scattering effects are not generally high in comparison with those of the anthropogenic aerosols in heavily polluted areas (with an exception of storm episodes where large amounts of coarse SSA are produced). However, the oceans cover 70% of the Earth whereas the highest concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols are confined to a relatively small part of the world. Therefore, the global annual impacts of anthropogenic and sea salt aerosols on the radiation budget are similar [ ; ]. The effect of SSA is particularly important in the Southern Hemisphere where SSA is the major particulate compound. Two other major aerosol sources there are biomass burning and DMS oxidation, which, however, contribute only marginally to the global atmospheric aerosol mass [ ; ; ]. Sea salt particles are hygroscopic and, in a humid environment, mainly exist as liquid droplets (but still referred to as “particles“ throughout this paper). They are also readily activated to form cloud condensation nuclei [ ]. With increasing concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei, the cloud microphysical properties change, i.e., the available water vapor is re‐distributed over more particles, on average resulting in smaller particle sizes, which in turn changes both cloud albedo and precipitation [ ; ; ; ]. The production of very coarse sea salt aerosols (dry particle diameter D P > 20 μ m) contributes to the transfer of heat and water vapor from the ocean to the atmosphere at very high wind speeds [ ]. With regard to the atmospheric transport, SSA particles are water‐soluble with size, density, and light‐scattering properties dependent on relative humidity [e.g., ]. The primary SSA removal processes are scavenging by precipitation and dry deposition (including gravitational settling). To quantify the distribution and the effects of sea spray aerosol, accurate estimates of the SSA production, dispersion, and sinks are required. The corresponding models have to include descriptions of the main quantities governing the above processes. Over‐simplified parameterizations may be insufficient because the changing climate will alter the surface winds, water temperature, salinity, etc., and thus change the conditions of sea spray emission and atmospheric dispersion [ ]. The SSA production at the sea surface is primarily dependent on wind speed but other parameters influencing this process have been identified as well, e.g., seawater temperature and salinity, atmospheric stability, wave height and steepness [ ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ]. The wind stress at the water surface leads to formation of waves and, when the waves break, to formation of bubbles. The bubbles rise to the sea surface and, when they burst, seawater droplets are injected into the atmospheric layer adjacent to the water surface [ ]. A substantial fraction of the initially emitted particles falls back into the sea while other particles are mixed upwards due to turbulence. This bubble‐mediated SSA production mechanism is believed to be the main process responsible for sea salt production at moderate wind speeds [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. Bubbles bursting at the water surface produce two types of droplets: film drops ejected from the rim of the receding film cap when it breaks [ ] and jet drops formed from the break‐up of the vertically rising water jet from the collapsing bubble cavity [e.g., ]. The film droplets are smaller in size (mainly sub‐micron, up to hundreds per bubble), while the jet droplets (up to ten per bubble) are usually larger than 1 μ m in radius [ ]. At strong winds, the direct production of spume droplets from breaking waves becomes important [ ]. Spume droplets generally have a dry particle diameter D p larger than a few μ m, i.e., their diameter at formation is larger than 10 μ m resulting in an atmospheric life time which is so short that they have limited importance at regional and global scales. Multiple modeling studies have explored the main features of the SSA distribution over regions and the globe [e.g., ; ; ; ; ]. A major comparison of representation of aerosols in global models has been made by the AeroCom community ( ) [ ; , and references therein]. A critical analysis of the SSA modeling approaches can be also found in the major review of , hereinafter referred to as LS04. The main goals of the current study are the development and evaluation of parameterization of the SSA emission, which would include the other key factors than wind speed controlling the bubble‐mediated production, i.e., water surface temperature and salinity. The specific objectives are: (i) to develop a comprehensive and computationally efficient parameterization of the sea salt emission for particles with D p ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ m and for environmentally relevant ranges of water temperature and salinity, (ii) to implement the emission term in the dispersion model SILAM (System for Integrated modeling of Atmospheric coMposition), and (iii) to apply and evaluate the developed system at European and global scales. Therefore, the current paper is mainly limited to discussion of particles with D p < 10 μ m and on the bubble bursting process as the production term. The local effects of surf zones and very high wind speed conditions are out of the scope of the study. Basic Terms and Equations The SSA emission is commonly parameterized in terms of a source function, which describes the upward flux of sea salt particles at or near the ocean surface as a function of atmospheric and oceanic parameters. For practical purposes the effective flux is often evaluated at an effective height of 10 m above the sea surface [ ; ; ]. In general form: _placeholder_formula_ Here F is the effective particle number flux from a unit area of open water, so that is the flux density for an infinitely small range of the dry particle diameter D p [ μ m], expressed in [# μ m −1 m −2 s −1 ], U 10 is the wind speed at 10 m above the water surface [m s −1 ], T w is the water temperature [K], S w is the water salinity [relative unit]. In the general form, the emission depends on all parameters of the rhs of the equation and their effects can be inter‐connected. However, in most parameterizations the processes are separated and, for instance, the dependence on particle size is considered only for some of them. This is somewhat artificial since there is neither strong experimental evidence that any of the forcing mechanisms affects production of particles of all sizes equally, nor strong evidence that these mechanisms can be considered independently from each other. For instance, some observations suggested that both bubble and aerosol spectra vary with wind [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. It was noted [ ; ] that coarse particles can be suspended in the atmosphere longer at higher wind speed due to mechanical mixing compensating the gravitational fallout. In that case, a larger fraction of the coarse particles can reach the reference height of 10 m above the water surface and be counted as “emitted.” Finally, the experiments of demonstrated the dependence of the aerosol spectrum on water salinity and temperature. Considering these effects, the wind speed is the primary driver of the total aerosol production, whereas its impact on the particle spectrum is much smaller than that of water temperature and salinity. This impact is also smaller than the overall uncertainty of the existing SSA source functions. Therefore, in the current work the SSA production is approximated as the product of a shape function (differential density of the SSA number flux – per unit whitecap area and unit D p range), which depends only on particle size and not on any of the meteorological parameters, and several forcing terms: _placeholder_formula_ where the forcing terms correspond to effects of wind speed (through the whitecap fraction), water‐temperature, and salinity denoted as W , F TW and F SW , respectively. Throughout this paper, the particle size is characterized by its dry diameter D p . To relate the particle sizes at different ambient humidity, suggested descriptions of growth of different salt particles with increasing relative humidity, RH, but these require numerical solution of a transcendental equation. An accuracy within ∼3% from SSA observations can be also obtained from empirical relations for relative humidity 98% > RH > RH deliq , where RH deliq = ∼50% is a deliquescence relative humidity [ ; ; , ; ]: _placeholder_formula_ Here D 0,S is the diameter of a droplet formed from seawater with salinity S , D RH is the equilibrium diameter of the particle at relative humidity RH [fraction]; and ρ s and ρ 35 are the densities of a droplet at salinity S and 35‰, respectively. Since ρ s deviates from ρ 35 by less than 1%, this term is usually omitted. For SSA, a simple relation D p = 0.5 D 80% is valid with < 5% error. is used hereinafter for conversion between the different humidity and salinity values reported by different authors, but with two amendments. First, it is applicable up to RH crit ∼0.98 whereas numerical schemes and parameterizations of atmospheric models allow RH > 1 in cloudy conditions. Therefore, for RH > 0.98, we replaced the formula with its linear extrapolation starting from RH = 0.98. The values of RH > 1.03 are considered erroneous and replaced with RH = 1.03. Second, for RH < RH deliq the dry particle diameter is used. Most formulations for wind‐forcing are expressed in terms of the fraction of the water area covered by white caps (whitecap fraction, W ). ] suggested an empirical power law fit for W as a function of the wind speed at 10 m above the surface U 10 : _placeholder_formula_ Other formulations for W have been published in the literature, which can diverge from by up to an order of magnitude [ ; ; ; ; , and references therein] but is the most widely used for modeling. Formulations for the shape function, dF 0 / dD p vary widely as well. One of the most used functions was suggested by , which, in terms of D p , reads as: _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in μ m. This shape function was obtained from laboratory experiments for the production of SSA within the D p size range from 0.8 μ m to 8 μ m. Numerous other schemes have been developed apart from [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , and references therein]. Some of them utilize directly the Monahan function and extrapolate it to larger and/or smaller particles [e.g., ; ; ; ], others attribute different mechanisms of SSA production to different parts of the spectrum, so that a resulting curve becomes a sum of two or more (lognormal) distributions [e.g., ; ]; several approaches use polynomial fits and their combinations with other functions [e.g., ; ; ], etc. Comparison of some of these source functions [ ; ; ; ] shows that, within the ranges for which the schemes were derived, their predictions are within one order of magnitude. It was noted however, that extrapolation significantly outside the original parameter ranges can lead to unpredictable results. Thus, according to , the extrapolated Monahan parameterization over‐states the production of particles with D p < 0.1 μ m, but under‐estimates the flux for 0.1 μ m < D p < 1 μ m. It also underestimates the flux for very large particles ( D p > 10 μ m), for which the formulations of can be used instead. A significant weakness of most of the currently used parameterizations is that they depend only on wind speed and do not include any effects of water temperature and salinity. However, as shown by , the variation of these parameters can change the production flux in certain size ranges by more than an order of magnitude. Recent work of has also demonstrated the importance of the sea surface temperature. Modeling Tools and Input Data The Modeling System SILAM The modeling tool used in this study for the evaluation of the new parameterization, as well as for the global and regional simulations is the System for Integrated modeling of Atmospheric coMposition SILAM [ , ]. Its dynamic core currently includes both Eulerian and Lagrangian advection‐diffusion formulations. The Eulerian core used in the current study is based on the transport scheme of , , which incorporates the horizontal diffusion term and is combined with the extended resistance analogy of for vertical diffusion. The removal processes are described via dry and wet deposition. Depending on the particle size, mechanisms of dry deposition vary from the primarily turbulent diffusion driven removal of fine aerosols to the primarily gravitational settling of coarse particles [ ; ]. The SILAM wet deposition parameterization [ ; ; ; ] is based on direct observations performed for moderately hydrophobic aerosols (not sea salt, however). It distinguishes between sub‐ and in‐cloud scavenging by both rain and snow. The particle size dependence of the impaction scavenging is taken into account by increasing the scavenging rate for super‐micron particles in relation to their settling velocity. The system includes a meteorological pre‐processor for diagnosing the basic features of the boundary layer and the free troposphere from the meteorological fields provided by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models [ ]. Physical‐chemical transformation modules of SILAM include several tropospheric chemistry schemes, basic aerosol dynamics, and radioactive decay processes. The system accepts flexible definition of the particle size spectrum, which can be defined for each specific run depending on the application. In the current study, SILAM was used only as a hosting system for the SSA source term. Therefore, all other emission sources and all transformation modules were disabled leaving only transport and deposition modules active. The simulations were performed for the region covering Europe and Northern Atlantic for May–October 2003, full years 2000, 2007, 2009 and 2010, and for the whole globe for the full years 2001 and 2008. The choice of the years was somewhat arbitrary but we emphasized the recent years because of better quality of the meteorological data and more abundant observational data. The overall time span starting from 2000 covered the 11‐year the solar cycle, which might otherwise introduce a bias in a shorter‐period study. The resolution of the regional runs was 30 km while the global simulations were made with 1 degree grid spacing. The vertical grid consists of 9 unevenly spaced layers, with the lowest layer being 50 m thick and the ninth one reaching up to about 9 km above the surface. As shown by , this vertical structure is sufficient for accurate representation of the relevant concentration profiles and vertical fluxes. All simulations were made with a 15 min internal time step while the model results are provided as 1‐h averages. The computations were made with spin‐up of one week for regional and one month for global scales. The regional simulations were run with zero boundary conditions but over a sufficiently large domain so that the observational sites were more than 200 km from the border. The actual water temperature used in the model runs for the global simulations was obtained from the ECMWF analyses whereas the European model runs were made with seasonally averaged data with spatial resolution of 1°. Salinities were fixed at 33‰ for the oceans, at 9‰ for the Baltic Sea and at 0‰ for the fresh‐water basins. For the long‐term simulations, we used four bins with the D p ranges 0.01–0.1 μ m, 0.1–1 μ m, 1–2.5 μ m, and 2.5–10 μ m. Inside each range, the fluxes are integrated, and the volume‐weighted mean diameter of the particles is taken. This representation corresponds to the routine in situ observations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , which simplifies the model‐measurement comparison. The number of ranges, together with the volume‐weighted averaging and uneven distribution over the size ranges, provides accuracy better than ∼10% for both total mass and aerosol optical depth (AOD) [ ]. For the detailed spectrum evaluation, 8 months in 2009 and 2010 were computed with high spectral resolution (18 bins over 0.01–10 μ m range). For comparison with Na + observations in PM 2.5 and PM 10 , the Na + fraction in SSA mass was assumed to be 30% and the D p size ranges 0.01–2.5 μ m and 0.01–10 μ m were summed‐up, respectively. The computations of the AOD of the atmospheric vertical column are based on Mie theory [ ], which implementation in SILAM is described by . The refractive indices for the Mie computations are taken from the OPAC database [ ], whereas the size of the particles for the ambient relative humidity was computed using the . Meteorological information and necessary geophysical and land cover maps are taken from the FMI‐HIRLAM and ECMWF meteorological models. Initial Formulations and Input Data The SSA source function development is based on the parameterization of (further referred to as M86), equations (4), (5) , the data of (further referred to as M03), and the results of the SEAS campaign [ ] ( ). The formulation does not cover the size range D p < 0.8 μ m, which has long atmospheric lifetime and large contribution to the SSA surface area and thus to optical thickness ( ). This range therefore is the most important one for regional and global scales and for interactions with atmospheric chemistry and climate. The parameterization also does not include the particle flux dependence on water temperature and salinity. The actual water temperature during the experiment is not mentioned in the paper but as the experiment was performed in the laboratory, a typical room temperature of about 20°C can be assumed. The experiments were made in a small tank with artificial seawater with salinities of 0‰, 9‰ and 33‰ and water temperatures of −2°C, 5°C, 15°C, and 25°C. Bubbles were generated by an aerator and the SSA particles were produced when the bubbles burst at the surface. Particle size distributions in the size range from 20 nm to 3 μ m were measured in the headspace, which was first freed from particles by flushing the tank with the filtered air. Based on these observations, Mårtensson et al. suggested a parameterization, which, however, we found to be very sensitive to details of the numerical implementation. The coefficients of the suggested 6th order polynomial fits vary by over 15 orders of magnitude resulting in extremely fast fluctuations of the fit. In particular, no changes appeared possible in the definition of the size bins used in that work: different spectrum definitions appeared to change the fluxes. Therefore, below we develop the new parameterization using only the observations. The SEAS data set is the only one that has observations for particles smaller than 0.02 μ m. However, it was a field experiment conducted near the surf zone and thus influenced by local processes, which are beyond the scope of the current study. Since these processes mainly influence the coarser particles, we used the SEAS data only for particles smaller than 0.02 μ m. The water temperature and salinity were not explicitly reported but mentioned that they were similar to those of the reference values (25°C and 33‰). Suggested SSA Production Term In the current section, we provide a condensed description of the new SSA source term. More detailed discussion of the formulas, their connections to physical processes and relations to other models is given in . Adaptation of the Formulations to the Data The new shape function was obtained by modifying the equation (5) in order to fit the observations extracted from the paper for T w = 25°C and S = 0.033 (33‰) and the SEAS data for D p < 0.02 μ m. The resulting curve was extrapolated from 8 to 10 μ m to cover the whole target range 0.01–10 μ m. The advantages of the shape as a starting point are: (i) it was justified by (though the reasoning was later criticized by ), (ii) it is a widely used function, which simplifies the comparison with other models, (iii) it is monotonous, smooth, and requires only modest adjustments to fit into the and SEAS data. The only significant correction refers to sub‐0.1 μ m particles, for which an additional term has to be introduced to reduce the production. The resulting shape function for particles with D p [ μ m] ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ m reads as: _placeholder_formula_ The function is presented in together with the original and extrapolated formulations (5), the data and the SEAS shape function. Compared to the original formula (5), the ratio of exponents in reduces the production flux for particles smaller than ∼0.1 μ m while the adjusted coefficients in the other terms eliminate the under‐estimation of the flux in the 0.1–1 μ m range and maintain the overall scale. The corresponding mass and particle surface fluxes are presented in . Effects of Water Temperature and Salinity The shape function describes the SSA number flux at the reference temperature of 25°C and at the reference salinity of 33 ‰. Below, we compute the correction factors F TW , F SW from as functions of two variables – temperature/salinity and particle size. Effect of Water Temperature For water temperatures other than 25°C, the correction functions F Tw were derived by dividing the observed fluxes at T w = 15°C, 5°C and −2°C by the fluxes at 25°C. shows that the ratios of the production fluxes at these three temperatures to the flux at T w = 25°C are smooth and monotonically decreasing with increasing particle size. The apparent deviations from the otherwise good power law fit are around D p ∼ 0.1–0.2 μ m and D p ∼ 2 μ m where a few outliers appear in some correction functions (shown with lighter colors). These are related to non‐monotonicity of the particle size distributions measured by at different temperatures. refer to maxima in the size spectra at these diameters as modes, but do not present any explanation for the occurrence of these modes. Therefore, at this stage it looks premature to build parameterizations taking them into account. In the following we disregard these outliers and approximate the data with the power law functions ( ): _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in [ μ m]. Due to monotonicity of the dependencies with regard to water temperature, the correction factors for other temperatures can be obtained by interpolation. Lacking information to justify more complicated interpolations, we suggest the use of linear functions. There are no data for extrapolation outside the observed range for particles larger than 6–7 μ m and smaller than 0.02 μ m. However, for regional and large‐scale applications, a sea‐spray source function for dry diameters from 0.01 μ m up to at least 10 μ m is needed. Therefore, and by lack of any evidence of other extrapolations, the corrections were used for the sea‐spray particles with dry diameters up to 10 μ m. However, the uncertainty in the extrapolated production flux is anticipated to be large. Effect of Salinity The effect of salinity is evaluated following the same procedure as for the temperature correction. The salinity of 33‰ is taken as the reference and for other salinities the correction functions F Sw are derived using the ratios of the fluxes for 9.2‰ (e.g., Baltic Sea) and 0‰ (“fresh” water) to that at 33‰ (oceanic conditions). Fitting of these ratios to power law functions ( ) results in: _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in [ μ m]. There is no observational data for intermediate salinities but the trend is clear and monotonic: lower salinity leads to lower SSA production. Therefore we again suggest linear interpolation between these two functions. The functions apply only to the size range for which the measurements are available but we used them for D p up to 10 μ m. Similar to the temperature correction, the uncertainty of the extrapolation is anticipated to be large but its impact is limited because the contribution of coarse particles to the flux from low‐saline and fresh water is small ( ). Similar to F Tw , the fresh‐water ratio shows inhomogeneity at D p ∼ 0.1 μ m. However, since it again has no clear explanation, we still use the single fit over the whole D p range. For the applications, one has to keep in mind an ambiguity connected with the SSA production from fresh water. In the experiment, the “fresh” water was distilled water, which has much lower concentrations of dissolved matter, such as various salts and organic matter, than natural fresh water. Therefore, in the experiment, a large fraction of “fresh” water particles would evaporate completely before reaching the particle sampler while in natural water bodies the residual particles would remain. However, since there is no other information available, we used the data to obtain but would expect the flux from actual fresh‐water bodies to be somewhat larger than the one suggested by the parameterization. Evaluation of the SSA Emission Module Via SILAM CTM Calculations The new SSA production parameterization closely follows the shape function and data over most of their ranges of applicability ( ). For the finest particles, the SEAS shape is approached. The difference between the curves is smaller than the uncertainty of the functions themselves (e.g., three standard deviations of the data, p = 0.001), except for D p > 1 μ m, where the parameterizations differ by more than an order of magnitude and where the new parameterization follows the shape. Therefore the outcome of the existing evaluations of the original schemes ( , and SEAS) is applicable to the current one within the relevant particle size ranges and environmental conditions. In particular, was evaluated against direct flux measurements by and . The scheme was used in numerous studies, which included comparison of dispersion model results with observed concentrations [e.g., ; , chap. 4.1; ; ]. The effect of water temperature on the emission flux has been confirmed by eddy covariance measurements at Mace Head by and . Finally, used GCM GISS for comparison of the , and SEAS schemes and evaluation of their fluxes and particle size spectra. They showed that the SEAS scheme is closer to the observed spectra for sub‐0.1 μ m than other schemes but shows much too high contribution of coarse particles ( D p > 1 μ m). The parameterization was somewhat better in 0.1–1 μ m range. As seen from , the current parameterization approaches the corresponding schemes at each of these ranges. Since this comparison was made using different transport and meteo model than those of the current study, it was repeated following the same procedure as that of . Below, we concentrate on comparison of the SILAM model predictions obtained using the SSA parameterizations – with observations. Observations of sea salt were obtained from five sources: (i) a few independent campaigns that provided aerosol size distributions in the marine boundary layer [ ; ; ]; (ii) several sites of the EMEP network (Co‐operative Programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long‐range transmission of air pollutants in Europe, ) that perform regular analysis of Na + concentration in total PM; (iii) several EMEP stations that perform ion analysis of precipitation including Na + ; (iv) the satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, which can be considered representative for sea salt in remote regions (excluding areas with high influence of other aerosols); (v) the near‐surface concentrations for global SILAM evaluation were taken from the paper of and references therein. These data sets are complementary. Indeed, the comparison with size distributions shows the system's ability to treat particles of different sizes but, e.g., the absolute concentration may not be representative due to the small amount of data obtained from a limited area. The mass concentrations of Na + in aerosol are measured near the surface and mainly reflect the amount of coarse‐fraction SSA particles (the main SSA mass flux is within the size range 0.5–5 μ m – ). The scavenging with precipitation washes out the whole atmospheric column. Therefore, the Na + concentration in precipitation provides an insight into the column‐integrated mass of SSA, which in turn is directly linked to the mass production and removal terms. Finally, AOD is proportional to the total particle area, for which the production peaks at the sub‐micron size range ( ). The model‐predicted sea salt concentrations are affected by a large number of processes including SSA production, transport, and removal from the atmosphere. Inaccuracies of the transport model or precipitation pattern can thus be misinterpreted as errors in the production term or the errors can compensate each other. However, the above mentioned independent and mutually complementary types of measurements with substantially different features and observed quantities might reduce the chance of such flukes. Evaluation of the Sea‐Salt Size Distribution The SSA number size distributions produced by the SILAM run for 2009–2010 with high spectral resolution is compared with the data from a cruise at the North‐East Atlantic (NEAT) published by ] ‐ . The set of measurements represents a typical Northeast Atlantic SSA number size distribution for end‐1980s. The SILAM spectrum‐resolving computations were made for November 2009 and, for comparison, July 2010, thus meeting the NEAT season (late autumn) but not the year. In the current parameterization the spectrum depends on water surface temperature and salinity but not on wind speed or any other dynamic meteorological parameter. The selection of different years then allows for explicit verification of this assumption. Indeed, averaging over the same season ensures that the water temperature and salinity are similar, whereas the different years eliminate any apparent connection to the short‐term weather phenomena. Comparison of absolute levels of the concentrations indicates the stability of the frequency distribution of wind speed from year to year. As seen from , the key features of the NEAT size distribution are reproduced by the model: the absolute peak of number concentrations at 20–30 nm (if the nucleation‐produced aerosol with D p < ∼0.01 μ m is excluded – see ), decreasing contribution of coarser particles, and similar absolute concentrations over the part of accumulation mode 0.1–1 μ m. The only missing component refers to strong contribution of the local production of coarse aerosols ( D p > ∼2 μ m), which are under‐estimated. Slight under‐estimation of the fine‐particle concentrations may indicate too strong removal of sub‐micron particles in the model or the impact of aerosol processes. The shape of the fine‐particle range of the spectrum has to be clarified further with aerosol dynamic processes taken into account – nucleation in the clean marine atmosphere and coagulation sink for both newly nucleated particles and small sea salt aerosols. The slight difference between the spectra for November and July shows the impact of seasonal change. Stronger winds in November resulted in higher production of all particles (as well as their deposition), whereas colder temperatures suppressed production of coarse aerosols. As a result, the fine‐particle concentration is higher in winter by a few tens of %, whereas the load of the coarse ones stayed the same. Comparison for the spectra over different parts of the globe is shown in . There, four SILAM ranges are presented via their volume‐weighted mean D p . The SSA spectra observed from the cruises in open sea (panels in the upper two rows of the ) are reproduced well, whereas the coarse fraction is somewhat under‐estimated near the coast (lower two rows). The effect is particularly strong in Cape Grim, which spectrum is very heavily dominated by coarse fraction – much more than in other data sets. These are probably originated from local surf‐zone. Evaluation of the Bulk SSA Mass Concentrations Near the Surface The bulk SSA mass concentrations computed with SILAM for 2000 and 2007 were compared with in situ data measured at EMEP stations for the same years. Computed and measured annual mean Na + concentrations at all available EMEP stations (7 for 2000 and 22 for 2007) are presented as a scatterplot in . A similar scatterplot for the wet deposition is shown in . For the comparison the mass fraction of Na in SSA dry mass was assumed to be 30%. The spatial distributions of several key statistical characteristics can be found in the , for the same two years. The scatterplots in and the maps of the scores in the show that the predicted annual‐mean SSA near‐surface concentrations are reproduced very well, while the mean wet deposition is underestimated by about a factor of 3. The sites with wet deposition > 1 mg Na m −2 day −1 are reproduced poorly whereas the agreement for lower annual deposition is within a factor of ∼2. The correlations between the modeled and measured daily concentrations vary widely with the correlation coefficients exceeding 0.5 for several sites ( and ). Note that such correlation coefficient is already approaching the maximum reachable value (about 0.7) between the daily time series [see ]. The comparison of wet deposition time series is complicated due to very high variability of this variable and its dependence on quality of the input precipitation fields. In particular, the uncertainty of its statistics is always larger than a factor of two. As a result the model scores vary strongly between the stations and regions (see ). However, the tendency toward underestimation is visible for practically all stations for both years (but stronger for 2000). The underestimation largely originates from only partly reproduced deposition peaks reported by the observations (see example in for Southern Norway in 2000), which results in too small short‐term dynamic range of predicted wet deposition (up to 0.1 g Na + m −2 day −1 instead of observed maximum of almost 1 g Na + m −2 day −1 ). The underestimation of the peaks can have several reasons: (i) omission of the surf zone SSA emission and the spume‐drop production mechanism, (ii) missing wind gustiness, (iii) SILAM scavenging parameterization may be too conservative for highly hygroscopic aerosols, (iv) under‐estimated precipitation amount by the HIRLAM model in 2000 ( and Figure A3). Importantly, the appearance of the precipitation events is well reproduced by the NWP models ( ), i.e., the input information on occurrence of wet deposition episodes is available. The absolute amount of precipitation, however, has little effect on the wet deposition evaluation because even quite small rain removes the bulk of the SSA mass from the column (as these particles are the highly soluble and coarse). Indeed, the improvement in the precipitation data from 2000 (under‐estimated, Figure A3) to 2007 (mostly unbiased, Figure A6) somewhat reduced the wet deposition under‐estimation but did not eliminate it completely ( , Figures A2 and A5). To evaluate the impact of possibly too conservative SILAM scavenging parameterization, a sensitivity model run over 2007 was arranged with the scavenging rate increased 100‐fold. The resulting increase of total monthly wet deposition was from 10 to 15% in winter up to 20% in summer. Therefore, the limitations of the precipitation information and conservative SILAM scavenging parameterization are contributing but clearly not the main limiting factors, leaving the omitted contribution of the spume‐drop production, wind gustiness and the surf zone emission as the primary reasons for the under‐estimation. Considering the seasonal variations, the model showed a close match of both concentrations and wet deposition during summer but a pronounced underestimation during winter time ( ). The latter is expected because the particles with D p > 10 μ m are not considered in this study – but they are still generated and can be suspended in air during winter storms, thus contributing to the total mass (also inland). The generation of such large particles occurs not only via the bubble‐mediated mechanism considered here but also by direct tearing off the spume droplets from the wave tops at the wind speeds exceeding ∼9 ms −1 [ ; ; ]. Also, during the wintertime, the gustiness over the sea surface increases [ ] resulting in enhanced SSA production. Neglecting these processes in the present simulations can lead to significant underestimation of the SSA mass in winter, especially at the near‐coast observation sites. Evaluation of the near‐surface concentrations in different parts of the globe was based on the data extracted from the paper of ‐ . The observational plots were taken “as‐is,” whereas the SILAM results were summed up to D a < 10 μ m. This range probably deviates from the observations [ ], which typically cover particles with <10 μ m ambient‐humidity size, i.e., D p < ∼6 μ m. As follows from , such extension adds about 10–20% to the SSA mass production, which is within the uncertainty of the estimates. Increase of the concentrations is even lower due to high deposition rates of particles with actual diameter exceeding 10 μ m. As seen from , the model is capable of reproducing the range of concentrations from ∼1 μ g SSA m −3 at Alert and Palmer sites, up to 20–30 SSA μ g m −3 at Barbados and Bermuda, with intermediate levels shown at e.g., Cheju and Miami. A systematic underestimation is shown for Cape Grim, which has large fraction of coarse aerosols of presumably local origin. However, if compared with the Cape Grim observational results presented by , the agreement is substantially better ( , first row, third panel). The dissimilarity between the measurements can be due to the different years, instruments, and actual positioning of the inlets used for the measurement campaigns, Both sources mention PM 10 as the analyzed quantity. The seasonality is mostly dependent on the input wind speed, which seem to be reproduced at most of the sites. Large problems are seen only at Mace Head and Helmaey, i.e., in the Northern Atlantic, where winter maxima are not captured – similar to the above EMEP‐based comparison. In comparison with results of for individual schemes ( , , SEAS), the current model is in much better agreement at the tropical sites and shows similar performance in other parts of the globe. As shown in the sensitivity tests in , the eliminated underestimation of SSA in tropics is largely attributed to actual SST included in the new parameterization. Evaluation of SSA‐Induced AOD The global distribution of the SSA contribution to the AOD was computed with SILAM for 2001 and 2008 and compared with AOD provided by the MODIS instruments onboard the NASA satellites Aqua and Terra (Collection 5: for level‐2 data , for averaged values ) ( ). The comparison required pre‐processing of both MODIS data and SILAM output. First, the cloud contamination of the MODIS level‐2 data [ ; ] was reduced by removing pixels with AOD > 1 (see for more sophisticated approach). Then the frames were projected to the SILAM grid, aggregated for each hour, and the AOD observations falling into the same SILAM grid cells were averaged. Second, for each hour the SILAM output has been picked only for the grid cells where the MODIS information is available. These two steps ensured the maximum possible co‐location of the observations and model results both in space and in time. Co‐locating the data sets, however, is not enough: the MODIS AOD includes the contribution of aerosols of all types and origin, while the SILAM computations include only SSA. Hence the comparison was restricted to the areas where the SSA load is dominant, i.e., where the AOD is least influenced by non‐sea‐salt aerosols. These are the oceanic regions at the midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, the central part of the North Atlantic and the North‐Eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. These areas are encircled in . The comparison of the annual‐mean co‐located SILAM and MODIS AOD patterns shows that in the indicated SSA‐dominated regions their difference from each other is within 20–40% of the observed values (example in for 2001). In particular, a high‐SSA pattern in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude belt of 40S‐60S) is well captured: high AOD is predicted at the same latitudes, and its mean level inside the belt is within 20–30% of the observed values. The observed MODIS AOD reaches up to 0.2, with a weak and very wide peak around 60S. Likewise, SILAM predicts AOD close to 0.2 over the same region. Consideration of the AOD maps in and histograms in shows that the regions least affected by the contribution from terrestrial aerosol sources are the Southern and Northern Pacific Ocean. There, the MODIS and SILAM AOD histograms are very similar and the mean‐AOD difference is less than 2%. The difference between the two considered years does not exceed 10–15% in any specific histogram range (not shown). The impact of non‐SS aerosol on the AOD over the Northern Atlantic and parts of the Southern Atlantic and the Indian Oceans is noticeable from the shift of the predicted SSA‐only histograms to the lower AOD values as compared to MODIS. A specific source of uncertainty of the visible‐range optical instruments is that they cannot retrieve AOD through dense clouds and tend to over‐estimate the AOD at the edge of cloudy areas [ ; ]. The latter can be reduced but missing areas had to be excluded from the comparison. It is illustrated in where the areas of high SSA concentrations predicted by SILAM correlate strongly with the missing‐data parts of the MODIS frames. The reason is the correlation of the SSA emission with storms and cyclones accompanied with dense clouds. To quantify the effect, we compared the SILAM AOD histograms with and without MODIS‐based screening ( , first panel). As one can see, the mean regional AOD without MODIS‐based screening is higher by almost 20% than the value obtained from the co‐located data. Also, the fraction of cases of each specific AOD range recorded by MODIS is not uniform over the histogram but rather demonstrates a strong anti‐correlation with AOD: it falls from about 2% for low‐AOD cases to about 1% for AOD ∼ 0.3. Despite the difficulty with high‐AOD regions, the comparison of predicted and observed AOD in the cloud‐free areas (i.e., largely outside the high‐SSA zones) still provides sufficient amount of information for the model evaluation. But for studies solely based on the satellite AOD data, especially averaged over long time periods, the missing high‐SSA data may lead to significant bias toward smaller AOD. Apart from the histogram and annual maps analyses, a time‐resolving comparison of AODs was performed for all four regions marked in to highlight the model ability to reproduce the temporal dynamics of the SSA load (driven by wind rather than slowly varying water temperature). In agreement with the histograms in , both SILAM and MODIS data were centered around the AOD ∼0.07–0.1. For the Southern Pacific over 90% of the predictions are within the factor of 2 from the observations. The other regions show both somewhat worse correlation of the observed and predicted episodes and, where the non‐SSA impact is significant, systematic low bias (Atlantic and part of Indian Ocean). The strongest impact of non‐SS aerosols is in Northern Atlantic where the under‐estimation reaches ∼40% (also seen in ). Discussion Small Particles Over Sea The current SSA source function is derived for the SSA particles with D p between 0.01 and 10 μ m and its shape function for the number flux peaks at D p about 0.03 μ m. However, the suggested shape function falls toward 0.01 μ m somewhat faster than that of SEAS ( ). There are no direct observations of SSA below 0.01 μ m but recent high‐resolution general‐aerosol measurements in the marine boundary layer suggest that the main origin of smaller particles is nucleation [ ]. The suggested shape function takes it into account by reducing the production flux toward 0.01 μ m but the uncertainty is evidently large. For the temperature and salinity correction factors, the data set seems to suggest some leveling of the trends or at least an increase of uncertainty for 0.02–0.03 μ m particles ( ), whereas the limited number of observations around 0.02 μ m is not sufficient for quantitative analysis. Therefore, the extrapolation of the temperature and salinity corrections to D p < 0.02 μ m involves large uncertainties. A source of small non‐SSA particles, which can affect the AOD observations, is the DMS emission followed by oxidation and generation of sulphate aerosol in the free troposphere (FT) [ ; ]. This contribution is substantial over biologically active areas but has strong seasonality: it is practically negligible in winter while in summer up to 50% of cloud condensation nuclei can originate from DMS. At annual averaging, the DMS contribution to aerosols over open‐ocean areas is likely to stay within 10–30% of the total number concentrations. Since the DMS‐originating particles are formed by nucleation and grow up to CCN size ( D p ∼0.1 μ m), they will contribute to the corresponding spectrum ranges (however, the details of the spectrum modification are very uncertain). This addition to the SILAM‐predicted fields may result in some over‐estimation of AOD over the Southern Pacific but it also partly explains the under‐estimation over other regions ( ). Influence of Sea Surface Temperature The production term strongly depends on the sea surface temperature T w . As seen from the correction functions and , the effect of T w differs for different particle sizes, which can originate from the differences between the production mechanisms [ ; ; ; ]. The fine particles are mainly produced from the film droplets whereas the coarse ones are mainly produced from the jet droplets. The observations suggest that these processes have different temperature dependence: with decreasing water temperatures the film‐droplet production increases while the jet‐droplet production decreases. Both trends seem to be persistent: the 15°C production is an intermediate between the ones at 25°C and near zero ( ). Qualitatively, these observations can be connected with the smooth and monotonic decrease of water viscosity with increasing temperature (the surface tension varies by < 10% for the environmentally relevant temperatures and thus cannot explain the strong dependence): the kinematic viscosity falls from 1.8·10 −6 m 2 sec −1 at 0°C down to 0.9·10 −6 m 2 sec −1 at 25°C [ ]. Based on the above observations, one can argue that the jet‐droplets production is reduced in more viscous water while the film‐droplets production is enhanced. To illustrate the impact of T w on the SILAM simulations, the global model run over 2001 was repeated with the fixed T w = 15°C. The comparison of this sensitivity run with the basic simulations with the actual T w is shown in (basic run with the actual T w , panel b: for T w = 15°C). The base run showed the highest SSA concentrations at tropical and middle latitudes (0–50 degrees north and south). In the “roaring 40s,” particularly over the Southern Hemisphere, the wind speeds are higher than in other regions and thus the enhanced SSA concentrations are due to wind speed induced production. In tropical regions, however, it is the warm water that leads to enhanced SSA production. Indeed, the results of the sensitivity run ( ) show that the SSA concentration in tropical regions is much higher if the actual water surface temperature is used. In the polar areas the effect is opposite: the concentrations are lower in the actual‐temperature run. Finally, the overall sea salt mass production over the globe is about 1.5 times larger if the actual T w is considered, with the bulk of the mass emitted in the warm regions. The simulations also show that AOD is somewhat less sensitive to T w than the surface concentrations due to the larger contribution from sub‐micron particles, for which the water temperature effect is less strong than for coarser particles mainly contributing to the SSA mass. Still, disregarding the actual T w jeopardizes the agreement with MODIS observations. Comparing the AOD histograms for the sensitivity run in (fixed T w ) with the base run results in (actual T w ), one can see that the sensitivity simulations agree much worse with the observed AOD. Thus, near the tropics (Northern Pacific region, the actual T w is higher than 15°C) the region‐mean AOD of the sensitivity run is lower than the observations by nearly a factor of 2, while near the Antarctic (the real T w is colder than 15°C) it is higher by 10–20%. Influence of Water Salinity The physical ground of the water salinity impact on the SSA spectrum and production flux is quite straightforward: lower salinity results in smaller size of the particles after water evaporates from droplets. Since coarser particles are produced in fewer numbers, the overall production decreases. However, this effect is very difficult to verify due to the small salinity variations across the World's oceans, except for local seas, such as Baltic Sea. On the other hand, its importance for the corresponding regions is evidently very large. The salinity correction functions and indicate that, for the same wind speed and water temperature, the aerosol emission at the Baltic Sea would produce approximately ten times less SSA mass per unit area than at the open ocean. As an illustration, in the SILAM simulations for 2009 and 2010 the SSA production from the Baltic Sea area was separated from that of the Atlantic Ocean. As seen from , the contribution of the Baltic Sea emission to the SSA concentration even at the sea coast is about the same as that of the Atlantic Ocean. Further inland, the Atlantic Ocean SSA fraction is clearly over 50%. Without the salinity correction, the resulting SSA concentration at the Baltic coast would be 5–10 times higher in the SILAM runs. The credibility of the above model‐based conclusions can be verified only indirectly – via model‐measurement comparison for the region. A series of campaigns in Hyytiälä (∼150 km east of the Bothnian Bay, ∼200 km north of the Gulf of Finland) and Helsinki (southern coast of Finland) provided 9 months of observations of Na + in aerosol during 2009 and 2010. The main parameter for comparison was Na + concentration in PM 10 with limited data for Na in PM 2.5 . We assumed that sodium is entirely from sea salt and summed‐up the corresponding model size bins to obtain the predictions. The comparison ( ) showed that: (i) the model captured well the concentration of Na + in aerosol, especially for the coarse fraction – the scores are similar to those for the European measurements shown in (those sites are practically not affected by Baltic Sea); (ii) there is a tendency of over‐estimation of the fine fraction; (iii) correlation of daily time series for Na + in PM 10 is quite good. The comparison also showed that the 10‐fold reduced contribution of the Baltic Sea to SSA concentrations due to its low salinity is a step in the right direction. Otherwise the model over‐estimation at Hyytiälä would be very large and strongly differing from the model scores at the European sites ( ). There can be, of course, other model parameters affecting the comparison – e.g., the scavenging parameterization or the vertical profile accuracy. However, they affect the model comparison at all sites and thus cannot cover this 10‐fold jump. The only place‐specific factor refers to the missing surf zone emission in the Helsinki archipelago, which probably caused the under‐estimation of the concentrations and low correlation at that coastal site (Helsinki is the only coastal site in the data set). The SSA Budget Predicted by the SILAM Simulations The global budget of SSA includes three terms: production flux, dry deposition, and wet deposition. Their relations strongly depend on particle size and vary from region to region, depending on meteorological conditions. They also depend on implementation of the source term – especially dry deposition is sensitive to the vertical injection profile. The suggested parameterization uses the observations made at different heights above the water surface and assumes that the corresponding parameterizations ( , , SEAS) are representative for the effective emission flux at 10 m height. However, formal application of the above source term in the model leads to mixing of the SSA over the first layer (for regional and global models, often 50–100 m thick) within one model time step. For the current simulations, the first model layer was 50 m thick and the model time step was 15 min. As shown in section 2.9 of , this mixing does not lead to excessive errors for particles with D p < 20 μ m. Being released from a near‐surface wide‐area source, a substantial fraction of the SSA mass is removed from the air shortly after the release before it gets mixed throughout the boundary layer – the process formally attributed to dry deposition (see discussion in chapter 2 of ). Consequently, the comparison of the SILAM‐predicted dry and wet deposition shows that the dry deposition flux, together with sedimentation, contributes more than 50% to the removal, being especially large for coarse particles. Wet deposition becomes dominant in all size classes only outside the source areas. This conclusion is in line with estimates of the atmospheric life time with regard to these processes summarized in Chapter 2, Table 8 of . Comparison of the SILAM‐computed SSA concentrations with those computed by, e.g., and shows that the spatial distributions are similar. In terms of the total production and loss budget, SILAM predicted a global SSA emission of 6700 Tg yr −1 in 2001 and 7400 Tg yr −1 in 2008, which is within the range of other global sea salt flux estimates: estimated it as 1000 Tg yr −1 , 11700 Tg yr −1 , 5900 Tg yr −1 , 3300 Tg yr −1 , and 6500 Tg yr −1 . More estimates can be found in the review of , who showed a range from less than 2000 Tg yr −1 up to more than 20000 Tg yr −1 . The bulk features of the SSA budget ( ) qualitatively agree with the values reported by from the computations of the GCM GISS, which was tried with all emission schemes used in the current study: , , and SEAS. The wet deposition is somewhat weaker in SILAM computations: its ratio to dry deposition varies from 3 for sub‐micron particles to 0.3 for the coarse ones. Pierce and Adams's computations showed the max value up to 10 or even more for some parameterizations. The life time of the particles was somewhat shorter in those simulations: less than a day for coarse particles and less than 3 days for fine particles. However, the budget details, especially the SSA life time, should be considered only as very crude estimates where an agreement within a factor of 2 has to be compared with an order‐of‐magnitude uncertainty in the emission fluxes if the meteorological model is changed [ ]. Large uncertainties of these details are also stressed by (their section 2.7). Corrections to the SILAM budget could originate from several sources. The current simulations do not include the contribution of the spume particles. Their size is large and atmospheric life time is short, which makes them not very important for large‐scale dispersion, but they still contribute to the mass budget. A mild increase can also be expected if the wind gustiness is taken into account. Therefore, the above budget is likely to increase if these additional sources are taken into account. The simulations for the North Atlantic show that the main contribution to the sea salt mass in the atmosphere comes from particles in the 1 μ m–10 μ m size ranges with coarse particles dominating the mass in the lower troposphere: stronger mass emission flux ( ) outweighs their shorter atmospheric lifetime. However, the sub‐micron particles dominate the number concentration – both due to the stronger production ( ) and the longer atmospheric life time. This is in agreement with other modeling studies [e.g., ; ] and reflects the generally accepted estimates that super‐micron particles contribute about 95% of aerosol mass, but only 5–10% of number concentrations in the marine boundary layer [ ; ; ]. The comparison of near‐surface mass concentrations and AOD maps reveals both similarities and differences in their spatial patterns. The mass concentration decreases with growing distance from the sea and becomes negligible at a few hundreds of kilometers inland from the coast ( ). A qualitatively similar pattern is observed in the AOD ( ) but the gradient is smaller: whereas the near‐surface concentrations ( ) drop by a factor of 10–100, the AOD decreases by less than a factor of 10. This model‐predicted effect can also be seen from the AOD observations: e.g., at the eastern coast of South America the background AOD over land at ∼500 km inland is only 6–10 times lower than that over the adjacent areas of South Atlantic at ∼500 km offshore. This is to be expected since: (i) the sub‐micron particles can be transported far inland with minor removal, (ii) the aerosol surface emission flux is the largest in the sub‐micron range ( ) and the AOD is proportional to the particle surface area, (iii) the particles that have reached the free troposphere also can be brought inland thus contributing to AOD but not to surface concentrations, (iv) once the air parcel is away from the surface source of SSA (i.e., over land), the dry deposition quickly depletes the SSA mass in the lowest layer but not the upper ones, which would take longer time to deposit. Conclusions The presented sea salt emission parameterization combines several independent approaches and data sets. It takes into account the effects of wind speed, water salinity, and water temperature. The source function is applicable to SSA particles with dry diameters between 0.01 and 10 μ m, low‐to‐moderate wind speeds, water salinity ranging from 0‰ to 33‰ and water temperature ranging from −2°C to 25°C. The parameterization has been implemented in the modeling system SILAM and the system was used to simulate the sea salt concentrations for Europe and adjacent seas for the years 2000, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2010, and for the whole globe for 2001 and 2008. Model evaluation against several campaigns, long‐term in situ (for 2000, 2007, part of 2009 and 2010) and remote‐sensing data (2001 and 2008) showed that: (i) predicted AOD is very close to the MODIS‐observed AOD for the areas where it is dominated by SSA, (ii) mass concentrations and wet deposition flux are well reproduced during the summer whereas they are under‐estimated during winter in the Northern Atlantic, whereas in the other parts of the globe the seasonality is captured better, (iii) over the globe, the SSA spectrum is reproduced well, except for the coarse part, which is somewhat under‐estimated. The under‐estimation can be mainly attributed to the omission of the spume production mechanism from the current study. For wet deposition, the conservative scavenging parameterization in SILAM system and inaccuracies of the input precipitation information also played a role. Additional uncertainty was introduced by extrapolation of the water surface temperature and salinity corrections toward the particles larger than 6 μ m. The global emission of SSA in 2001 and 2008 was estimated as 6700 and 7400 Tg yr −1 , respectively, which is in the range of estimates provided by other models (1000–20000 Tg yr −1 ). Further efforts for the scheme refinement should address the coarse particle size ranges and the spume production mechanism. Acknowledgments The study has been performed within the EU‐GEMS project.

This region extends over 400 to 600 km to the south of the Sahara desert, depending on the year [ ]. The latitudinal gradient of precipitation is thus extremely strong, with about 1 mm km −1 [ ]. The rainy season, associated to the West African Monsoon (WAM) regime, lasts from May to October at most in Sahel, with a maximum in August [ ]. The annual rainfall amount is provided by a limited number of organized convective systems occurring during the rainy season [ ]. In response to this monomodal distribution of precipitation, the Sahelian vegetation is mainly composed of annual plants, scattered shrubs, and low trees, and it exhibits a well‐marked seasonal cycle [ ]. Annuals germinate after the first rains, in June or July, and unless the plants wilted before maturity because of lack of rain, plant senescence immediately follows the fructification, largely determined by plant sensitivity to the photoperiod and matching approximately with the end of the rainy season. The herbaceous growing season is followed by a long dry season of about 8–10 months during which there is no herbaceous growth. During this period, standing herb cover decreases slowly during the first part of the dry season. This decrease accelerates from March on as the air temperature and humidity build on. This strong temporal dynamics associated with wide spatial heterogeneity raises a challenge for modeling vegetation dynamics over the Sahel belt. Furthermore, reliable rainfall maps are critical to the investigation of scientific issues such as dust emission in semiarid regions [e.g., ; ] or hydrological regimes [e.g., ]. In the semiarid region of Sahel, the most limiting factor for plant growth is the water content in the rooting zone [e.g., ; ]. In consequence, the timing of plant growth depends on the rainfall volume and distribution during the rainy season [ ]. Indeed, the extent of the seasonal growth of annual herbaceous not only depends on the annual precipitation amounts, but also on their distribution over time and space [ ]. Accordingly, precipitation data sets with high spatial and temporal resolutions are requested as main inputs in vegetation dynamical models. As an example, the Sahelian Transpiration Evaporation and Productivity (STEP) model [ ] requires daily rainfall inputs. Since the Sahel droughts in the 1970s to 1980s, the mechanisms controlling the monsoon system have been largely studied [see e.g., ; ]. Direct measurements of rainfall using gauges are performed in a network of meteorological stations, while indirect assessments of rainfall are increasingly carried out using censors onboard satellites. However, the gauge network is too sparse in many regions of the Sahel to allow precise estimates of the spatial pattern of precipitation at local (away from the gauge) to regional scales. Nowadays, the temporal distribution of precipitation can be investigated at regional to continental scales using a new generation of precipitation products combining infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) measurements [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ]. These products benefit from the good sampling rate of IR measurements from geostationary satellites and from the relatively high confidence level in rainfall estimates provided by MW sensors onboard various polar satellites. Many studies have already investigated the quality of these high spatial‐and‐temporal resolution precipitation products [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ], but few of them focused on criteria relevant to the modeling of Sahel vegetation at a regional scale, which implies working at daily to decadal time steps over several years. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the skills of rainfall products when used in vegetation modeling over the Sahel. The evaluation includes (1) the intercomparison of three selected rainfall products on criteria relevant to vegetation growth modeling which, according to the literature [e.g., ; ; ], are the timing and amounts of rainfall on a daily time step, the timing and duration of dry spells, and the spatial pattern of the rainfall fields; and (2) the test of the selected rainfall products in vegetation growth simulations. To do so, three satellite‐based precipitation products are chosen for their representativeness of current satellite‐based rainfall products. They are intercompared over a wide region that include the Sahel (10°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E), and tested against rainfall maps derived by kriging from the network of rain gauge data available over a slightly smaller region (10°N–17.5°N, 17.5°W–22.5°E) that encompasses the nine member countries of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS). The different data sets are presented in , and the methodology for comparing these precipitation products is detailed in . describes the main results obtained for each criterion of comparison (spatial pattern, rainfall daily occurrence, and dry spell duration and distribution, and rainfall amounts), and illustrates how these different rainfall attributes have an impact on the numerical simulations of the Sahelian vegetation at a regional scale, especially by comparing simulated vegetation fields to vegetation index maps from satellite observations. A concluding discussion is given in . Precipitation Data Sets Satellite Precipitation Products Retrieving rainfall fields at fine scale – i.e., 10–50 km and 1–3 h resolutions – is highly challenging, especially in the Sahel. Great improvements in satellite‐based rainfall estimation are provided by combining geostationary IR measurements with passive MW measurements. Indeed, if the satellite‐borne MW instruments can provide rainfall rates with good accuracy, only two measurements per day are available at the same location because of the polar orbit of the satellite. Conversely, the geostationary IR satellites offer a quasi continuous temporal coverage but less precise quantitative information. More recently, active MW measurements (radar) have also been used aboard satellites for precipitation measurements, providing a more accurate estimate of rain intensities but with a lower time sampling than that of IR and passive MW satellites. Three rainfall precipitation products derived from satellite measurements have been selected with regard to their spatial and temporal resolution ( ). The Climate Prediction Center Morphing (CMORPH) [ ] and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42v.6 [ ] precipitation products are available at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and a 3 h time step. Among the products that present the required temporal and spatial resolutions, CMORPH is considered as typical from the real‐time products like Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) [ ] or TRMM Real‐Time product (TRMM3B42‐RT) [ ]. In the same way, the TRMM3B42 is taken as representative of global well‐calibrated products such as Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMAP) [ ], besides the fact that TRMM3B42 is widely used by the scientific community [e.g., ; ; ]. The Rainfall Estimate (RFE2.0) product [ ] has a finer spatial resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) and a daily time step. It is chosen as a typical regional African rainfall product, like Estimation des Precipitations par Satellite‐Seconde Generation (EPSAT‐SG) [ ]. For these three products, the algorithms combine several types of measurements, mainly IR and MW, and two of them (RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42) also incorporate data from rain gauge measurements. These two last products have already demonstrated good skills over the Sahelian belt when compared with rain gauge observations in terms of precipitation distribution and basic statistical parameters [e.g., ; ], which justify the present effort to better characterize their ability as input in vegetation modeling. The CMORPH product has been selected to investigate the confidence that could be expected from near‐real‐time vegetation modeling. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Product 3B42v.6 (TRMM3B42) The TRMM started in 1997 in a partnership between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). First, each MW satellite observation (SSM/I, Special Sensor Microwave Imager; TMI, TRMM Microwave Imager; AMSR, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer; and AMSU, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) is converted to rainfall estimate using its proper algorithm. Then the microwave precipitation estimates are calibrated and combined (using probability matching of precipitation rate histograms). Then, IR precipitation estimates (GMS, Geostationary Meteorological Satellite; GOES, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, Meteosat; and NOAA‐12, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) are created using the calibrated MW precipitation, and the MW and IR estimates are combined. As a last step, monthly accumulated rain gauge data from the Climate Assessment and Monitoring System (CAMS) produced by NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and rain gauge product from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) are incorporated [ ] ( ). Rainfall Estimate 2.0 (RFE2.0) The RFE2.0 product was developed at NOAA by the CPC [ ]. The algorithm merges IR (GOES), passive MW (AMSU, SSM/I), and gauge measurements as follows: each type of satellite observation is converted to a rainfall estimate using its proper algorithm, then weights are calculated for each satellite rainfall estimate by comparison to gauge measurements (when and where they are available). The rainfall estimates are combined using these weights to remove random error. Then systematic bias is eliminated by adjusting the relative distribution previously obtained to gauge measurements which provide the magnitude of the rainfall field. As mentioned in , the gauges used in this algorithm are the ones belonging to the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) network, which consists of about 1000 operating gauges in Africa. CPC MORPHing (CMORPH) The CMORPH product [ ] has been developed by the NOAA CPC. The algorithm is based on a combination of passive MW observations from low‐orbited satellites (the TMI, three SSM/I, three AMSU, and one AMSR) with spatial propagation information deduced from IR observations obtained by geostationary satellites (Meteosat) ( ). More precisely, MW observations are converted to cloud features and rainfall estimates. When no passive MW data are available, the cloud features previously obtained are propagated by motion vectors derived from IR imagery, and then morphed using a linear combination of weights regarding the time from the nearest passive MW sensor. Thus, in this algorithm, IR imagery is not used to estimate rainfall but to derive motion vectors. Gauge Data Three networks of rain gauges are working in the Sahel. The whole operational CILSS network is composed of about 600 rain gauges located in nine African countries (Burkina‐Faso, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Cape‐Verde Islands, Gambia, Guinea‐Bissau, Chad, and Mauritania). The AGRométéorologie‐HYdrologie‐METéorologie (AGRHYMET) regional center (CRA) manages a monitoring network composed of about 250 rain gauges that is included in the CILSS network. The data are available on a 10‐day basis at the CRA. The synoptic network (SYNOP) is composed of 80 rain gauges, and data are available on a daily basis through the GTS. This network is included in the CRA network [ ]. The average number of gauges from these networks is around 600, but it can vary significantly from one year to another [ ]. The present localization of the CILSS and SYNOP stations is provided on . These networks have a relatively dense coverage at the regional scale with a density of approximately one station per 3500 km 2 . However, the stations are not homogeneously distributed over the region. The network is sparser in the northern part of the area, and no data are available over Nigeria (10°N–12.5°N, 4°E–14°E). After testing different kriging algorithms, proposed a method to deliver optimized interpolated precipitation fields based on the measurements from these networks. These interpolated fields are produced at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° with a 10‐day time step. They extend from 10°N to 17.5°N and from 17.5°W to 22.5°E, except for the year 2007 for which they cover the area ranging between 17.25°W–22.25°E and 10.25°N–20.25°N. Since the kriged data are not real ground truth, they carry an uncertainty that might bias comparisons with other rainfall field estimates [ ; ; ]. These interpolations of rain gauge measurements will be, in a certain extent, considered in this study as the “best estimate” against which satellite‐based products are compared, as shown by . However, the possible bias due to the scarcity of the rain gauge network must be kept in mind since the uncertainty on rainfall estimates depends strongly on the rain gauge network density and on the duration of aggregation [ ]. Methodology Both the intercomparison of three satellite‐derived rainfall products and the test of these products with the map of precipitation fields interpolated from rain gauge data are performed with several criteria relevant to vegetation modeling in the Sahel. As indicated in section 2.2, the rainfall fields resulting from kriging rain gauge data cannot be considered as “the truth” since they can present strong uncertainties, particularly when rainfall is weak and gauges density is low, as in northern Sahel (north of latitude 15°N) and at the edges of the rainy seasons [ , ]. To deal with these limitations, decided to retain only grid cells with at least one gauge in it, but only 21% of the grid cells satisfy this condition over the June to September periods from 2004 to 2006. Moreover, the kriged data are only available at a 10‐day time scale, which does not enable comparisons to be performed on the daily distribution of the rainfall and the timing of dry spells. For these two reasons (sparsity of the gauge network in the north of the area and decadal time step), intercomparisons between the different satellite‐based products are performed to provide useful information that complements results obtained with the kriged‐satellite products comparison. Indeed, although they are based on similar measurements (IR and MW satellite observations, and rain gauges for two of them), the three selected satellite products are established with different algorithms. The consistency between the three products is thus investigated first. The comparison with interpolated gauges measurements enables to estimate the quality of the satellite‐based products in terms of agreement with ground‐based data sets. As emphasized by , each criterion can lead to a different ranking of the products; it is thus important to consider a range of criteria. Here, three criteria are selected: the spatial pattern of rain fields that should contribute to retrieve the spatial pattern of vegetation growth at a regional scale; the frequency of rainy days and the occurrence of dry spells because of the strong sensitivity of Sahelian vegetation to the temporal distribution of the rain [see e.g., ; ; ]; and the precipitation amounts as a driver of vegetation growth and amount [ ; ]. For each of these three criteria, the comparison is carried out following , by answering the following questions: how does the quality of the products vary in space? how does this quality vary through time? and what is the quantitative difference between the products? The comparison is carried out over 4 years, 2004 to 2007. This duration is a compromise between the availability of the different data sets and the minimum duration required to take into consideration, at least in part, the interannual variability of the precipitation in the Sahel region [see e.g., ]. In each year, the investigated period is restricted to the rainy season, i.e., from May to October, as in the study by . The intercomparisons of satellite‐based rainfall products have been performed over the whole Sahelian belt (10°N–20°N; 20°W–35°E). The kriged rain gauge data sets being available only from 10°N to 17.5°N and from 17.5°W to 22.5°E, the comparisons between the satellite products and these data sets have been restricted to this area. CMORPH and TRMM3B42 products are both provided with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and can therefore be compared directly at this resolution. Besides, the resolution of the RFE2.0 product is finer (0.1° × 0.1°). However, for the sake of consistency, the RFE2.0 product has been aggregated at the same resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° as CMORPH and TRMM3B42. The time scales used in the intercomparison of satellite products range from 1 to 10 days, depending on the data sets. Because of the resolution of the data set, the comparisons with rain gauge kriged data are performed at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° with a temporal resolution of 10 days. The results of the tests on the structure, frequency, dry spells, and amounts of the precipitation fields are successively presented in . Results Spatial Structure of the Precipitation Fields The first step of our analysis is to check the global consistency between the different satellite‐based precipitation products and of these satellite products with the kriged data. Although the good skills of the selected products have been demonstrated by and , this step is performed to confirm these results over the Sahel region from 2004 to 2007, which are wider and longer than in the previous studies. The objectives of this section are (1) to check the location and the extent of the rainfall fields and the consistency of their relative proportions and (2) to estimate the consistency of the temporal variation of the structure of the rainfall fields between the products. This is performed by examining (1) the spatial distribution of the precipitation cumulated over the 4‐year period and (2) the average temporal variation of the normalized precipitation rates. Satellite‐Based Products Intercomparison Spatial Distribution of the Rainfall Field The consistency of the spatial distribution of the precipitation fields is first examined at the regional scale. To this end, the precipitation fields from each product are cumulated over the four rainy seasons (values over oceanic areas are disregarded). In order to minimize the variability due to differences in rainfall intensity between the satellite products, the cumulated precipitations are normalized to their respective maximum over the whole studied area. The consistency of precipitation fields at regional scale is checked by examining the distribution of the annual mean rainfall for the rainy season (May to October) averaged over the period 2004–2007 ( ). The CMORPH distribution is much more stretched than those of the two other satellite products, with a mean value of 527 mm, against 303 mm for TRMM3B42 and 314 mm for RFE2.0, and a maximum value of 2409 mm, against 1419 mm for TRMM3B42 and 1177 mm for RFE2.0. However, the mean/maximum ratio is similar for CMORPH and TRMM3B42 (0.22 and 0.21), while it is slightly higher for RFE2.0 (0.26), indicating that this product shows more frequent high‐precipitation events. The three satellite‐based precipitation products provide similar spatial structure of rainfall fields over the Sahel ( ). Especially, both the northern limit of observed precipitations (located around 18°N in the western part and 15°N in the eastern part) and the location of the relative maxima (located around 15°W and 12°N and around 8°E and 10°N) are clearly coherent in the three products. On the other hand, some differences are observed in the southern part of the area between 20°E and 30°E with very low normalized precipitation values for TRMM3B42, while CMORPH and RFE2.0 products suggest relatively high precipitation in that area. Nevertheless, the spatial structures of all three satellite‐based precipitation products are largely coherent. Ten‐Day Rainfall Variability To evaluate the consistency between the different satellite products through time, the spatial correlation coefficients between pairs of satellite products are computed every 10‐day period from May to October over the 4‐year period. As already pointed out by , the correlation coefficient measures the cofluctuation of the products and is not sensitive to bias. The computed correlation coefficients range between 0.6 and 0.9 (for n∼8000 for CMORPH/TRMM3B42, n∼2000 for CMORPH/RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42/RFE2.0), indicating a significant level of coherence at the decadal time step between the different data sets. Moreover, the values of the correlation coefficients do not vary significantly along the rainy season nor during the 4‐year period: for a given year, the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient is around 5% of its annual mean for CMORPH/RFE2.0 and CMORPH/TRMM3B42, and around 8% for TRMM3B42/RFE2.0. They are also stable from one year to the other: for each couple of satellite‐based products, the standard deviation of the annual means is ∼2% of the 4‐year global mean. It must be noted that the correlation coefficients are more scattered in 2005 (with CMORPH/TRMM3B42 having the lowest values), and to a lesser extent in 2007. These results suggest that the quality of the satellite products remains relatively constant from the intraseasonal to the interannual time scales. Comparison with Kriged Rain Gauge Fields Spatial Comparison The three satellite products are compared with the precipitation fields derived from kriged gauge measurements (further referred as “kriged fields”). In a first step, the comparison is performed on the cumulated and normalized precipitation fields, for the area over which kriged fields are available, i.e., about one half of the area previously concerned for the satellite‐based precipitation products comparisons. The kriged fields over most of Nigeria (see , white box), are excluded from the analysis since no gauge measurements were available from this country. For each product, the distribution of the 4‐year mean rainfall field was first examined over the area where rain gauge measurements are available ( ). As already observed over the large domain, the CMORPH distribution is much more stretched than those of the two other rainfall satellite products with a mean value of 770 mm, against 445 mm for TRMM3B42, 453 mm for RFE2.0, and 424 mm for the kriged fields. The maximum values are 2409 mm for CMORPH, 1419 mm for TRMM3B42, 1177 mm for RFE2.0, and 1330 mm for the kriged fields. The mean/maximum ratio is similar for CMORPH, TRMM3B42, and the kriged fields (0.32, 0.31, and 0.32), while it is again slightly higher for RFE2.0 (0.38). The main patterns of the rainfall fields are similar for the kriged fields and the satellite products ( ). The relative maxima of precipitations are located in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the studied area for all precipitation data sets. However, some disagreements are observed in the southwestern part of the area, where the extent of high precipitation is larger on kriged fields than on the satellite‐based rainfall fields. Note that the density of the gauge network is important in this region, and thus, the confidence level of the associated kriged fields is high. On the other hand, the computation of the kriged fields should yield a smoother spatial pattern of precipitation fields, and this can partly explain the differences observed between kriged fields and satellite‐based rainfall fields in this area. Ten‐Day Variability The spatial correlation coefficients between the decadal rainfall fields derived from satellite‐based precipitation products and the kriged fields are computed from 2004 to 2007 (not shown; n∼1200). The resulting correlation coefficients are lower than those obtained for the intercomparison of the different satellite‐based precipitation products. They range approximately between 0.3 and 0.9 (against 0.6 to 0.9 for the intercomparison), and about 9% of the values are lower than 0.6. The correlation coefficient is particularly weak from May to August 2005 for the TRMM3B42. However, these correlation coefficients remain largely significant, indicating an overall good agreement between satellite‐based precipitation products and kriged fields. By taking into account estimation error uncertainty, especially sampling error [ , ], comparisons would yield to even higher correlation coefficients [see ]. The correlation coefficients are stable over the rainy season: for a given year, the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient is ∼10% of its annual mean for CMORPH and RFE2.0 (against 8% for satellite products only) and 12% to 27% for TRMM3B42. When averaged over the rainfall season (May to October), the correlation coefficients are stable from one year to another: for the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products, the standard deviation of its annual mean is about 2% of the 4‐year global mean. This variability of the correlation coefficients is higher for the TRMM3B42 product, with a standard deviation of its annual mean of 8% of the 4‐year global mean, mainly because of the poor agreement observed for 2005. Conclusion Concerning the Spatial Structure of the Precipitation Field The three selected satellite‐based precipitation products provide coherent spatial structure of the rainfall fields over the whole Sahel. Moreover, the comparisons between these satellite products and the gauge‐interpolated measurements, even if they have been performed over a smaller area, suggest that the structures provided by the satellite products are also in good agreement with precipitation fields derived from gauge measurements. This reinforces the results obtained by previous studies on smaller areas and shorter periods [ ; ]. Rainfall Frequency and Dry Spells As shown by , the spatial distribution of total precipitation amounts is first determined by the number of rain events at different locations, and second, by how much it rains during these events. Moreover, rainfall frequency and dry spell occurrences are critical issues for vegetation growth. This has already been pointed out among others by for crops. The aim of this section is to check if the rainy days and the dry spells occur at the same time for a same location, and in the same proportions for the three satellite‐based rainfall products. Since kriged fields are only available at the 10‐day time scale (which is not sufficient to work on rainy days or to detect short dry spells), this analysis is carried out on a daily basis, but between satellite products only. The annual number of rainy days is assessed separately for each rainy season 2004–2007 and for each satellite‐based precipitation products ( ). The mean annual values vary between approximately 100 and 150 rainy days (for a 184‐day period) at the very south of the studied area to 0 rainy day at its northeastern edge. CMORPH and RFE2.0 show very similar patterns, while the TRMM3B42 product provides a lower number of rainy days, especially over the 10°N–12°N latitudinal band. Satellite Based Precipitation Products Global Scores The consistency of the rainfall frequency provided by the satellite‐based precipitation products has been quantified by computing an agreement score between the different products in terms of the detection of rainy days (rainfall > 0 mm) or nonrainy days (rainfall = 0 mm). These scores (expressed in percent) have been computed for each pixel and for the 4‐year period of interest (2004–2007) over the Sahel. Four cases have been distinguished: (1) the two satellite products A and B agree on the rainy day (y/y); (2) the two satellite products A and B agree on the nonrainy day (n/n); (3) product A indicates a rainy day, but product B does not (y/n); and (4) product A indicates a nonrainy day and product B indicates a rainy day (n/y). These categories can be compared with the False Alarm Ratio (FAR) and the Probability of Detection (POD) as defined in . However, since we do not have any absolute reference here in terms of daily rain detection, we preferred to use explicit names of the different cases. The scores corresponding to agreements for rainy (y/y) or nonrainy days (n/n) are high (about 80% when summed) for the three pairs of satellite products ( ). These scores are almost equally driven by the rainy and the nonrainy cases, the number of y/y cases being slightly lower than the number of n/n cases. Concerning the cases of disagreement (y/n and n/y), it can be noted that RFE2.0 detects more rainy days than CMORPH, which detects more rainy days than TRMM3B42 (as also observed in ). Since the mean annual rainfall was higher for CMORPH than for RFE2.0 (see and ), this suggests that the precipitation events are of lower intensity for RFE2.0 than for CMORPH. A complementary insight about the consistency of rain distribution between the studied products bears on the dry spell analysis. Usually, a dry spell is defined as a period of consecutive days without rain, embedded in the rainy season [e.g., ; ]. A threshold can be defined to detect the next rainy day that ends the current dry spell. A criterion has also to be defined to detect the beginning of the rainy season or the date of a possible germination, in order to reduce the analysis to the sensitive period for vegetation. Based on the work of and , it was decided to define the date of possible germination by the first day after 1 May when rainfall is at least 12 mm or when rainfall accumulated over 5 days is at least 20 mm. The analysis is carried out until the end of September, since October matches with the senescence stage, when annual vegetation is not sensitive anymore to dry spells. Moreover, a very simple hydrologic budget is computed by subtracting an evapotranspiration of 2 mm per day [see ]. Here, a dry spell is thus defined as consecutive days with a null hydrologic budget. The global mean dry spell distribution over the 2004–2007 seasons restricted as described above is expressed in terms of the relative area concerned by dry spells by counting the number of grid cells concerned for each dry spell duration and dividing it by the total number of grid cells ( ). Similar behavior is observed from the three selected satellite‐based rainfall products: dry spells shorter than 4 days are numerous (over 20% to 35% of the area), then the distribution shows a strong decrease (5‐day dry spell represents about 5% to 10% of the area), and a continuous decay for longer dry spell (dry spells longer than 20 days bring a very small contribution). The proportion of the studied area concerned by dry spells is of the same order for the three products. However, there is a local maximum in the distribution for the 4‐day dry spells for TRMM3B42 and CMORPH, which does not appear for RFE2.0. All these observations remain valid when performing a year‐by‐year analysis (not shown). Spatial Comparison The scores of agreement (y/y and n/n) of the different satellite‐based precipitation products have been cumulated for the four rainy seasons and are displayed on maps ( ). Large parts of the area (76%, 60%, and 37% for CMORPH/RFE2.0, CMORPH/TRMM3B42 and TRMM3B42/RFE2.0, respectively) show agreement greater than 80%. The higher levels of agreement are reached over the regions where precipitations are either very high (central south of the area) or very weak (northern part of the area). The minimum score is about 40%. For the three pairs of satellite‐based precipitation products, the agreement scores are lower (but still higher than 50%) between 14°N and 16°N, i.e., the zone corresponding to the northern limit of the precipitation and along the Atlantic Ocean coast. Smaller areas of disagreement are located in regions including water bodies such as Lake Chad (13°N, 15°E). This is likely due to a “mixed pixel” effect (pixels over Lake Chad are considered as coastal water or coastal land) which reinforces the inconsistency due to the differences between the proper algorithms of the three products: propagation of passive MW along the motion vectors derived from IR measurements for CMORPH, weighted mean of MW retrieval and IR‐based estimates (adjusted by monthly gauge data at nearby location) for TRMM3B42, and a similar methodology for RFE2.0 (adjusted by daily gauge data) but with different sets of passive MW and IR estimations derived from a different technique. The lowest agreement scores are obtained for the couple TRMM3B42/RFE2.0. This is consistent with the global scores given in the previous section, indicating that the RFE2.0 product detects more rainy days than TRMM3B42. Besides water bodies, disagreements are thus located over areas of intermediate rainfall amounts. The geographical pattern of the mean annual number of dry spells lasting 5 days or more ( ) brings complementary information. As expected, a north‐south gradient appears, with more dry spells at the northwest of the area (with a lighter extent for TRMM3B42), and almost none at its southern edge. Numerous dry spells are also observed between 30°E and 35°E at 16°N, particularly for the TRMM3B42 product. Gray cells correspond to “always‐dry” zones (where the germination criterion is never met); these gray cells are least numerous for the CMORPH product. In other words, slight differences are observed between products in terms of spatial repartition of the dry spells, particularly in zones where vegetation is the least likely to develop (north and east). A specific analysis of the impacts of these differences on vegetation simulations is carried out further. Daily Variability To evaluate the temporal variability of the agreement in detecting rainy days, scores of agreement (y/y and n/n) or disagreement (y/n and n/y) are computed for each day of each year over the whole area. The results obtained for year 2006 are displayed in . The temporal evolutions of these scores differs from one couple of rainfall products to the other. For each couple, the agreement on rainy days increases from the beginning to the middle of the rainy season and then decreases. Total precipitation exhibits the same pattern [see e.g., ] suggesting a coinciding increase of the frequency and intensity of the precipitation, in agreement with the observations of . On the other hand, the agreement score on nonrainy days is obviously the minimum at the maximum of the rainy season and the maximum at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, where nonrainy days are the most frequent cases. The total agreement scores are stable during the whole period for the couple CMORPH/RFE2.0, but exhibit a slight seasonal trend for the pairs involving the TRMM3B42 product, suggesting a seasonal bias in the detection of rainy days for this product. For the CMORPH/RFE2.0 couple, the two scores corresponding to disagreement (y/n and n/y) have comparable values and temporal patterns. The scores for the pairs involving TRMM3B42 differ significantly, underlining, as noticed previously, that the TRMM3B42 product detects less rainy days than the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products. The same features are noticed for the other years of the studied period (not shown). A similar day‐by‐day analysis in terms of dry spells yields similar conclusions (not shown): the mean dry spell duration is longer at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, and it reaches a minimum at its core. This mean duration is slightly greater for CMORPH since the dry spells computation for this product includes more cells (that meet the germination criterion) at the northern edge of the area of interest, which shows low rainfall and very strong intermittency. Conclusion on Rainfall Frequency and Dry Spells A satisfying global agreement between the different satellite‐based precipitation products was found for the daily rain detection and dry spell analysis, especially in areas where rainfall is either very weak or very strong. A weakest, but still very good agreement is also observed in areas exhibiting intermediate rainfall patterns, i.e., in the Sahelian area stricto sensu (100 to 600 mm, i.e., approximately between 14°N and 16°N, see ). This underlines the need to focus analysis on the specific criterion of rainfall daily frequency. Moreover, this good level of agreement persists all through the rainy season. For the TRMM3B42 product, the comparison with the other satellite‐based precipitation products suggests a seasonal bias in the detection of the rainy days, and a slightly different spatial distribution of dry spells. As a general trend, the rainfall frequency is the highest with the RFE2.0 product and the lowest with the TRMM3B42 product. Rainfall Amounts The consistency of the precipitation amounts is examined for the different satellite‐based precipitation products. First, a direct comparison is performed over the whole Sahel and over the CILSS countries area; second, the spatial distribution of the rainfall differences between products is examined; finally, the temporal evolution of the agreement between products is evaluated. Satellite Products Ten‐Day Precipitation Amounts Direct comparisons of 10 day precipitation amounts from a couple of satellite‐based precipitation products are performed at a spatial resolution of 0.5° (n∼100,000) over the whole Sahel (10°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E, values over oceans being removed) for the four rainy seasons of the period 2004–2007 ( ). Overall, the agreement between the three satellite‐based products is good: the correlation coefficients range between 0.41 and 0.65, and the slopes of the linear regression range from 1.48 to 0.78. The slope of the linear relationships between the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products is the highest (1.48) and is associated with the slowest intercept (4.3 mm) and a medium mean absolute error (17.8 mm). The squared correlation is the highest with about 0.65 (meaning that 65% of the variability of the data is explained by the linear regression). The slope of the linear relationship between the TRMM3B42 and CMORPH products is very close to 1, but the intercept and the mean absolute error are the highest (13.1 mm and 21.4 mm, respectively), suggesting a small systematic bias between these two products. The correlation coefficient is lower (0.43) and close to the 1 obtained for the TRMM3B42/RFE2.0 couple (0.41). The linear regression between TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 gives a slope of 0.8, without significant systematic bias (intercept ∼5.56 mm). Moreover the mean absolute error is the lowest with 13.66 mm. Spatial Distribution of Precipitation Amounts The differences between the different satellite‐based precipitation products in terms of precipitation amounts over the four rainy seasons 2004–2007 are displayed in . The highest differences in precipitation amounts involve the CMORPH product. The regions where the differences are the highest are located along the Guinean coast (15°W–10°W, 10°N) and in the southern part of the area, i.e., in the areas where precipitation is the highest. These areas almost perfectly match the maximum of relative precipitation of the CMORPH product. This clearly shows that the precipitation amounts derived from CMORPH are much higher than those from the two other products. In contrast, the areas where the differences are minimum are located at the northern edge of the studied area where rainfall is extremely weak. The two satellite‐based precipitation products using rain gauge data for adjusting their precipitation rates retrievals, i.e., TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0, are in good agreement over most of the area. The differences are less than 100 mm in mean annual absolute value for 47%, 47%, and 87% of the studied area for CMORPH‐RFE2.0, CMORPH‐TRMM3B42, and TRMM3B42‐RFE2.0, respectively. Higher differences are observed in a zone located in Sudan (25°E–35°E, 10°N–12°N) for which the precipitation derived from TRMM3B42 is significantly lower than that derived from RFE2.0. As indicated in , the frequency of rain days detected is intermediate between the two other products for the CMORPH product. This strongly suggests that the large differences observed in the precipitation amount retrieved by CMORPH and those provided by the two other satellite‐based precipitation products result from a large “overestimation” of the daily precipitation rates for rainy days similarly detected by the other products. This overestimation of the rainfall amounts by CMORPH had already been noticed by for the June‐September 2004–2006 period and by at a global scale. Ten‐Day Variability In order to evaluate the consistency between the different satellite‐based precipitation products through time, the slopes of the linear regressions have been computed every 10‐day period from May to October over the 4 year‐period over the Sahel region. These slopes show a systematic trend: rainfall amounts derived from the RFE2.0 product are lower than those derived from TRMM3B42 (slope between 0.4 and 1) except at the very beginning and at the end of the rainy season (when the slope can reach ∼1.2). RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 values are much lower than those derived from CMORPH (slope from 0.2 to 0.8). The slopes, averaged over the rainy seasons are quite stable with standard deviations of the order of ∼10%. However, they can strongly vary as a function of the year for the same decade, with standard deviations up to 40%. Comparison with Kriged Rain Gauge Data Decadal Precipitation Amounts The precipitation amounts at 0.5° spatial resolution derived from the satellite products are cumulated by 10 day period to be compared with the 10‐days precipitation amounts from the kriged rain gauge data ( , n∼80 000). The comparison of the 10 day precipitation amounts shows a good agreement between satellite‐based estimates and kriged data: the squared correlation coefficients range between 0.6 and 0.7. These values are similar to those obtained by , but the number of values compared here is much higher; our period of interest is longer and our area is wider. The slopes of the linear regressions range between 0.77 and 1.34, and the intercepts are low (between 2.2 mm and 8 mm). The level of agreement is thus noticeably better than the agreement observed between satellite products, and compares well with the values obtained by on two 10‐day periods (11–20 June 2006 and 1–10 August 2006), taking into account estimation errors (squared correlations about 0.9, slopes about 0.8 to 1.3). If the kriged data are considered as a reference in terms of precipitation amounts, these results indicate that CMORPH overestimates precipitation amounts by about 34%, with a much larger systematic bias than the other products as reflected by the highest intercept (∼8 mm) and mean absolute error (22.2 mm). On the other hand, RFE2.0 tends to underestimate precipitation rates by 23%, with a lower bias (intercept ∼5 mm) than CMORPH and the lowest mean absolute error (∼10 mm). Moreover, RFE2.0 shows the highest squared correlation, with more than 69% of the variability of the values explained by the linear regression. TRMM3B42 exhibits the slope the closest to 1 (0.94) and the lower intercept (∼2 mm), suggesting a better agreement with the kriged rain gauge data in terms of precipitation rates. However, its squared correlation is 0.6, i.e., approximately equal to that of the CMORPH product. Spatial Distribution The differences in precipitation amounts between the satellite‐based precipitation products minus the kriged rain gauge data are computed for the four rainy seasons ( ). The largest differences are again located along the Guinean coast (13°W, 10°N), and the lowest ones, for the RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 products, are located in an intermediate strip, approximately between 13°N and 15°N. The differences are positive between the CMORPH data and the kriged rain gauge data, indicating much stronger precipitation amounts from the satellite‐based data. The RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 products are both in satisfying agreement with the kriged rain gauge data over most of the area with absolute differences lower than 100 mm over 78% and 76%, respectively, of the surface, but for only 27% for CMORPH. The kriged rain gauge data are generally slightly lower than the satellite products in the areas where high rainfall is observed (central and southern) and slightly greater on the northern borders, where rainfall is the weakest. The underestimation of satellite‐based products with respect to kriged data for low rainfall amounts can be partly explained by the underestimation of the frequency of small rainfall linked to high spatial intermittency [ ]. Ten‐Day Variability The slopes of the linear regressions of precipitation amounts every 10 day period between satellite‐based precipitation products and kriged rain gauge data (not shown) confirm the differences previously noted between the three satellite products. The slopes between satellite products and kriged data are higher at the beginning and at the end of the rainy seasons, while they are minimum, and generally closer to 1, in the middle of the rainy season. This better agreement with kriged data at the core of the rainy season was also observed for other satellite‐based rainfall products [ ]. For the CMORPH product, they largely exceed 1 both at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, while they range between 1 and 2 between July and September. This indicates that the precipitation amounts are overestimated by CMORPH during the whole rainy season, but less toward the middle of the wet season. Moreover, the interannual variability observed is the strongest with the CMORPH product. The slopes of the regressions with RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 are significantly closer to 1, even if they also decrease in the middle of the wet season to reach values of the order of 0.5. This suggests that these two satellite products could underestimate precipitation amounts during a period of high rainfall. It can be noticed that the values for 11–20 June 2006 and 1–10 August 2006 for the TRMM3B42 product compare very well with the values obtained by (slopes of 0.83 and 1.29, respectively). The three satellite‐based rainfall products studied here show similar field structure and daily frequency over the Sahel. Those characteristics are also in good agreement with the 10‐day kriged rain gauge data over the Sahel. However, the CMORPH product tends to overestimate rainfall amount over the Sahelian belt. In the following section, we will discuss the influence of the use of these different rainfall fields on the Sahelian vegetation modeling. Vegetation Modeling Simulations of seasonal variations of the Sahel vegetation have been performed with the STEP model [ ]. This model has been specifically designed to simulate, at a daily time scale, the growth of the Sahel annual herbaceous by describing explicitly the physical and biological processes associated to plant growth (photosynthesis, respiration, senescence, and litter production) and water budget (evaporation, transpiration, and water fluxes in the soil). The modeled vegetation consists of an herbaceous layer composed of annual species. From the simulated biomass, vegetation structural parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Vegetation Cover Fraction, and vegetation height are estimated, allowing comparisons with satellite or field measurements [e.g., ; ]. The main required input data sets are daily meteorological data (air temperature, global radiation, and rainfall) and soil characteristics (texture with depth, albedo), input parameters being the initial green biomass (B g0 ), the C3/C4‐plants proportion, the maximum conversion efficiency (ɛ c ), and the Specific Leaf Area at emergence (SLA 0 ) (see ). Implementation of the STEP Model at the Regional Scale The STEP model [ ] is a one‐dimensional model that has been designed to run on well‐documented sites. The aim here is to perform vegetation simulations over the whole area of interest, i.e., to determine the values of the different input variables and parameters. In that regard, the strategy depends on the model sensitivity to these inputs. The most determinant input variables are first, daily rainfall, and second, solar radiation, yet solar radiations seldom limit vegetation photosynthesis in the Sahel environment, contrary to rainfall. Calibration Parameters According to several previous studies dealing with the STEP model [e.g., , ; ], the most sensitive parameters are the maximum conversion efficiency ɛ c , the initial green biomass B g0 , the C3/C4‐plants proportion, and the Specific Leaf Area at emergence SLA 0 . A thorough description of these parameters can be found in the article by . The C3/C4‐plant proportions and SLA 0 are difficult to evaluate at a regional scale. Default values obtained from 25 years of ground measurements over the AMMA‐CATCH site in Mali [ ; ; ] are considered here, and in consequence, the simulations are performed on an area restricted in latitude (12°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E) to match with the appropriate type of vegetation. The two other calibration parameters, B g0 and ɛ c , are determined using satellite observation products as reference. The LAI designates the one‐sided leaf surface per soil unit surface (in m 2 /m 2 ). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product [ ] – onboard the TERRA and AQUA platforms – is retained for its fine resolution (∼1 km, 8 days) and its good skills over Sahel [ ; ], except an offset of about 0.2 m 2 /m 2 during the dry season. Using both the MODIS LAI data (LAI MODIS ) as a reference and typical values of SLA for Sahelian grass species [ ], the initial biomass is estimated as follows: B g0 = LAI MODIS /SLA. From this, regional simulations have been performed and values for the ɛ c parameter have been determined by minimizing the difference between simulations and MODIS LAI data in four zones. These zones were defined for their contrasted behaviors in terms of absolute differences with respect to MODIS LAI values. The obtained values range between 3.0 and 6.0 g/MJ, which are in agreement with previous studies [e.g., ; ]. Meteorological Data and Soil Characteristics As mentioned in section 1, the objective is to evaluate different rainfall products as inputs in regional vegetation modeling. Thus, the three satellite‐based rainfall products were successively used as inputs to perform vegetation simulations using the STEP model. The other meteorological parameters are operational data from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). Soil texture profiles are adapted from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) [ ], which is the finest available soil database. Its resolution is ∼1 km, but data were aggregated at the 0.1° or 0.25°, depending on the rainfall product used. Surface albedo is the product provided by the MODIS database. Vegetation Simulations and Comparisons to MODIS Observations Vegetation Dynamics The seasonal dynamics of the green biomass is simulated for the year 2004 by using TRMM3B42 rainfall data ( ). No green vegetation is simulated during the dry season until approximately beginning of July (day of year (DOY) 180). As simulated by the STEP model, annual vegetation starts growing as soon as the humidity of the soil is greater than the wilting point during 5 consecutive days. The plant growth lasts until approximately early September (DOY 250) matching with the biomass maximum and the fructification stage. Finally, the senescence takes place from the maximum of biomass to end of October (DOY 280). The sensitivity of the simulations to the use of the different satellite‐based rainfall products is evaluated by examining the main features of the vegetation dynamics over years 2004 to 2007: the location of the northern limit of the vegetated area, the date of beginning of the plant growth (T 0 ), the date of biomass maximum, and the LAI values at T 0 + 15 days and at maximum. In the context of the strong latitudinal rainfall gradient in Sahel, the latitudinal location of the northern limit of annual vegetation growth is an important issue in estimating the regional agreement between simulated and observed seasonal vegetation. More precisely, the following comparison aims at checking whether the modeled vegetation is spatially and temporally consistent at the regional scale with the satellite observations. The grid cells for which the northern limit of the vegetated area is detected are reported according to their latitude as obtained from STEP simulations versus their latitude as obtained from MODIS observations ( ). Their cumulated frequency across longitude over the whole area of interest is indicated through a color scale. The graphs illustrate the cumulated results over years 2004 to 2007 for the first day of each month from May to October (growing season) and separately for each satellite‐based rainfall product used as rainfall inputs in the STEP model. The correlation coefficient between latitude of the northern limit of simulated and observed vegetation is also indicated on each panel. The grid cells are smaller and more numerous for the RFE2.0 product as its resolution is 0.1. A perfect agreement between observations and simulations would correspond to all grid cells aligned on the 1:1 line. On the whole, seasonal vegetation is not well developed before July, and the agreement between simulations and observations is poor until this date. The best agreement is observed for 1 August and 1 September, whatever the rainfall product, that is in the middle of the growing season when vegetation density is at maximum. A poor agreement is also observed for 1 October, corresponding to the senescence stage. This observation can be done for the three rainfall products suggesting that the STEP model does not simulate this last vegetation stage well. Moreover, the northern limit ofthe vegetated area is located further south by the model in comparison with satellite observations from August to October (the points are located above the 1:1 line). Although these trends are observed for the three satellite‐based products, correlation coefficients show some variability. The best agreement (over the whole rainy season) is found when using the CMORPH product as rainfall input, which was rather unexpected since CMORPH shows the strongest disagreement with kriged gauge rainfall data. The cumulated distributions of the date of beginning of vegetation growth for the different products are displayed in . The distributions for the simulations run with TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 show a very similar behavior, in good agreement with MODIS observations, with an inflection point at the end of May (around DOY 150), when the vegetation starts to grow over most of the area. The vegetation growth as seen by MODIS starts about 20 days earlier than the modeled values using the satellite estimates. This is mainly because the STEP model prevents vegetation to start growing before 1 May in order to avoid unrealistic starts over the whole Sahelian band. By early September (approximately DOY 250), herbaceous vegetation has started to grow in almost all grid boxes. The simulations run with CMORPH show an earlier onset of the vegetation cycle that concerns a relatively high fraction of the studied area. In other words, vegetation growth begins roughly 5 to 20 days earlier with the CMORPH product than with others. This result is in accordance with the rainfall overestimation of this product with respect to the others. The area covered by the simulated vegetation growth is also slightly larger when using CMORPH precipitation than when using the two other precipitation products (for example, in 2004: 51% (MODIS), 48% (CMORPH), 39% (RFE2.0), and 47% (TRMM3B42) of the area is covered by vegetation). The distribution of the date of vegetation maximum is less scattered between products ( ). In the simulations, the main inflection point occurs in early September (around DOY 250), and by the end of October (DOY 300) the whole vegetated area has reached its maximum whatever the satellite‐based precipitation products used as input, and for the MODIS observations as well. From a regional point of view, the simulations reach their maximum at a smoother rate than MODIS observations. TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 products show very similar responses in terms of vegetation simulation, as was expected because of their very similar daily rainfall frequency and amounts. Vegetation Amounts An illustration of the impact of differences between products on modeled vegetation in terms of dry spells is given by , for the year 2004 and the CMORPH and TRMM3B42 products. MODIS maximum LAI are represented on to facilitate the interpretation of these results. The area where TRMM3B42 presents more dry spells lasting 5 days or more than CMORPH appears on (blue color). On , as expected, this corresponds to area where the maximum simulated LAI is larger when using CMORPH than TRMM3B42 (yellow color), and where MODIS maximum LAI shows intermediate values (∼1–2 m 2 /m 2 ). However, the opposite behavior is observed at the southwest section of the area, where MODIS maximum LAI are 2 to 3 m 2 /m 2 : more dry spells for CMORPH and a larger maximum simulated LAI. This can be explained by the much higher rainfall amounts of the CMORPH product with respect to TRMM3B42 in this area (see and ). Statistical values of the linear regression between vegetation simulations and MODIS observations are given at 15 days after growth beginning, T 0 + 15 ( ) and at vegetation maximum ( ). Simulated values are well correlated with the observed ones at T 0 + 15: correlation coefficients are about 0.7 whatever the rainfall input source, and slopes are larger than 1, indicating that LAI are overestimated by the STEP model by 40% to 70%. At vegetation maximum, correlations (>0.8) show a very significant agreement between simulations and satellite observations, and intercepts are low (lower than MODIS offset in the dry season) [see ]. However, the model underestimates by almost a factor of 2 the MODIS LAI values at vegetation maximum. These results suggest that the vegetative cycle is satisfyingly reproduced by the model (see good correlation coefficients) over the whole Sahelian belt, especially in terms of seasonal dynamics. Yet, the simulated cycle is less marked than the observed one in terms of vegetation amounts. Conclusion Since the three satellite‐based precipitation products have very similar daily precipitation frequencies (see ), the large differences in dynamics observed between the simulated vegetation fields are mainly due to the overestimation of rainfall amounts by CMORPH, especially at the beginning of the rainy season. Earlier precipitation from CMORPH allows the simulation of the beginning of the vegetation growth at a period for which the necessary conditions are not yet fulfilled for the other products. When considering LAI values, the correlation coefficients are larger for CMORPH used as rainfall input, but with a wider value departure between simulated and observed LAI. In other words, comparison of vegetation simulations for the different satellite‐based product confirms that impacts of rainfall characteristics like amounts or frequencies are not straightforward on the agreement with observed vegetation. These results can be put in perspective with recent works dealing with hydrological modeling as by (who intended to build metrics interpretable by hydrologists and algorithm developers at hydrologically relevant scales) and (who studied the skills and impacts of the use of TRMM3B42RT and TRMM3B42v.6 on hydrological modeling in China). Other recent studies deal also with land‐surface modeling using satellite‐based rainfall products as by (comparisons of land‐surface models over west Africa using the TRMM3B42 product) and (computation of large‐scale water cycle over West Africa using rainfall from meteorological models). However, the impacts of rainfall estimates variability for modeling show strong specificities depending on the scientific issue under consideration [e.g., ]. Conclusion Three satellite‐based precipitation products (CMORPH, RFE2.0, and TRMM3B42) have been intercompared and tested against interpolated rain gauge measurements over a four rainy season period (2004–2007) to evaluate their ability to retrieve the precipitation characteristics that drive seasonal vegetation growth throughout the Sahel region. The criteria of comparison are defined according to their relevance for vegetation dynamics: spatial structure of the rainfall field, precipitation frequency and dry spell distribution, and precipitation amounts. The time scale used for the satellite product intercomparisons is from 1 to 10 days, and the spatial resolution is of 0.25° × 0.25° to 0.5° × 0.5°. Vegetation simulations are performed using a vegetation growth model specifically developed for Sahel over a slightly smaller area, and the simulations are compared with satellite observations (MODIS LAI). The three selected satellite products are found to be in good agreement over the Sahel region for the three criteria. In terms of spatial structure, the three satellite‐based precipitation products are also in a good agreement with the kriged rain gauge data, which is consistent with previous works performed over smaller area or periods [e.g., ; ]. Moreover, this agreement is relatively stable through time, from intraseasonal to interannual scales. The three satellite‐based precipitation products meet a high agreement (around 80%) in terms of detection of rainy days. However, the intercomparison of precipitation amounts between the satellite‐based precipitation products and the comparison of the satellite products with the kriged rain gauge data clearly indicate that the CMORPH product overestimates rainfall amounts, while both TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 are in good agreement together and with kriged rain gauge data. When considering vegetation modeling, good agreement is also observed between the dynamics of vegetation growth simulated by STEP using the satellite rainfall products and the satellite observations at a regional scale. This agreement applies to the date of vegetation growth beginning as well as the date of maximum vegetation growth. However, the amounts of vegetation at growth beginning (maximum) are overestimated (underestimated) by the model runs. Differences between satellite rainfall products are retrieved in the model outputs, particularly the earlier start of vegetation growth when using the CMORPH product. Simulations obtained with TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 have similar behaviors, in good accordance with MODIS observations. This is in agreement with the comparable characteristics of these two products according to our intercomparison criteria. The good skills of the selected products, although already observed on shorter area or period, are confirmed over the whole Sahelian area on a pluriannual time scale. The specific analysis, focused on the use of these products for vegetation modeling, suggest a new approach and methodology of comparison, and link the results of this comparison to vegetation simulations. The present work can be considered as a typical example of synergistic research between precipitation estimation missions and surface‐vegetation‐atmosphere modeling and measurements. Among the current comparable research programs, further scientific investigations could be performed with, for example, the Megha‐Tropiques mission or the NASA/JAXA Global mission, and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) space mission.
