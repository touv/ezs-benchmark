[{"id":0,"value":"Introduction Since the early days of seismology, the ubiquitous noise with periods 5 to 10 s has been clearly associated to ocean wave activity (for a historical account, see ). The corresponding ground motions have vertical excursions of the order of a few micrometers, hence their usual name microseisms. The detailed relationship between microseisms and ocean waves was only clarified much later with the observation by that the dominant frequency of microseisms is the double of the dominant ocean wave frequencies and follows its changes, suggesting that partial standing waves could be the origin of the recorded noise. The theoretical works of on the pressure induced by partially standing waves was the missing link that led to propose the first plausible theory of seismic noise generation as seismic Rayleigh waves generated by surface gravity waves in deep water. The theory was generalized to random waves by . The lack of a theoretical understanding did not prevent various propositions for using seismic noise as a source of information on ocean storms and weather, or for wave forecasting [ ; ], and a practical use of wave‐measuring devices based on seismometers eventually emerged [ ]. Yet, by the 1980s, ocean technology allowed routine wave measurements by buoys at sea, making the seismic ‘wavemeter’ almost obsolete. Further, satellite altimeters and synthetic aperture radars have provided routine and accurate measurements over the entire globe since 1991 [e.g., ; ]. The coarse space‐time and spectral coverage provided by satellites leaves an important potential use for seismometer‐based techniques in areas where in situ measurements are inexistent or not available [e.g., ]. The presence of low‐frequency energy in seismic records is a clear indication of long period waves associated with the most severe storms, as shown by and and can be used to investigate extreme wave events. Also numerical wave models need to be corrected for time‐dependent biases that are caused by the time‐dependent errors in the winds used as input [e.g., ]. Finally, seismic noise is related to the poorly known directional distribution of wave energy [e.g., ], and is also uniquely sensitive to very long period swells and their fore‐runners, with periods longer than 20 s, that are the fingerprints of the most severe storms [ ; ]. There is thus a need for understanding the seismic data for the analysis of ocean wave properties. Beyond the estimation of present sea states, the reconstruction of past time series of ocean wave parameters has emerged as a new possible application. Old seismographs go back to the early 20th century, which is 80 years before our modern age of space‐based measurements of ocean waves. , analyzed seismic noise variability at stations around the North Atlantic, from 1906 to 1980, to find evidence of a solar cycle in the the storm climate. He concluded that there is an 11‐year cycle in the seismic noise. Looking at his time series with our modern eyes, we rather see a correlation of noise levels with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Unfortunately details about the seismic data processing are missing to further verify that work. This quest for a quantitative link between wave climate and seismic noise has been taken up by others, with noteworthy efforts by for California, and for the North‐East Atlantic, while the analysis of many seismic records around the word indicate upward trends in seismic noise levels that was interpreted as an increase in ocean wave heights [ ]. Based on ocean wave buoy measurements, some skill was shown for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height ( H s ) over a few month period for Central California. the correlation was probably r ( H s ) > 0.8 for hourly time series, with Pearson's linear correlation for a quantity X defined by _placeholder_formula_ where the overbar denotes the arithmetic average, and X obs and X mod are the observed and modeled series. For the North Atlantic, a numerical wave model was used to find a significant correlation ( r = 0.71) for 6‐hourly time series between winter waves in various regions of the North‐East Atlantic, and noise levels at the Hamburg seismic station [ ]. Yet, with that correlation, seismic noise explains only half of the wave model variance ( r 2 = 0.5), and this was only applied to winters. It is thus premature to use results of these earlier studies to conclude on the general feasibility of wave estimation at other locations. Further, the retrieval of sea state parameters is not guaranteed beyond the seasonal time series that were studied. Thus, either for present‐day or historical wave reconstruction, there is a clear need for defining the conditions in which wave parameters can be estimated from seismic data, and to explore the systematic differences in sea states that may yield different seismic responses. The goal of the present paper is to extend these previous studies toward robust and generic methods for estimating sea state parameters from seismic noise. For this, we build upon the recent improvement in numerical wave models [ ; ], and the resulting good performance of a direct model of seismic noise. Seismic noise model results are well correlated with observed root mean square vertical ground displacements amplitudes. (hereinafter ASSM) obtained correlations higher than 0.85 for 4‐hourly seismic data over the entire year. also independently verified the location of the sources with the measured polarization directions of Rayleigh waves. This model may thus be used to guide the interpretation of seismic noise records, especially for estimating the locations of the noise sources and thus the locations where sea state parameters may be retrieved. However, this kind of model does not include three‐dimensional seismic propagation effect and may fail to explain the noise recorded at some seismic stations. In particular, it is important to recognize that several publications, most conspicuously the analysis of typhoon Ioke by , Figure S2] failed to find evidence of seismic noise propagation as surface (Rayleigh) waves from deep water to land. Along this line, many published analyses of seismic data interpret high noise levels from some direction that intersects the coastline as evidence for the importance of the coast in the generation of this noise [ ; ; ]. Others interpreted their measurements as evidence of this deep water to land propagation [ ; ; ; ]. From observations alone it is clearly impossible to decide on the position of one or several sources along a great circle in a given back‐azimuth. This is where a numerical model provides interesting additional quantitative information by estimating the plausible energy levels of the sources at each point in the ocean. Because of that controversy, we discuss below the quality of the model and the resulting uncertainties on the location of modeled noise sources. Our numerical model supports that there are plausible sources of Rayleigh waves generated in deep water that occasionally dominate the signal recorded at land‐based stations, including stations in California. These modeled deep sources occur systematically at the same time as the largest outliers in the correlation of wave heights and seismic noise levels. We shall thus use these modeled sources as a proxy for outliers in order to reduce our errors on wave height estimation. After a review of the underlying theory in , we will discuss, in , why and how seismic noise correlates with sea state parameters for seismic stations dominated by nearshore seismic noise sources, with or without wave reflection at the shoreline. In we explore the case of seismic stations that record noise generated in large areas. In both cases we propose a method for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height. Wave‐Noise Relations Expected From Theory General Considerations Ocean waves are known to generate microseisms via at least two distinct generation mechanisms. Primary microseisms, with a frequency equal to the ocean wave frequency, are only generated on sloping shallow topography in coastal areas [ ]. Here we only consider the secondary microseisms, which are far more energetic and generated over large regions of the ocean. They appear when ocean wave trains with nearly opposite directions and identical frequency f are superimposed [ ; ], which makes noise at the double frequency (DF) f s = 2 f. Following , we neglect changes in seismic group velocity U along their propagation path. We further assume that seismic waves are damped with a quality factor Q , such that, for a given seismic station, UQ is a constant for all the dominant seismic modes recorded by a given seismometer. The seismic noise power spectrum F δ recorded on the vertical component at a station of longitude λ and latitude ϕ on the Earth's surface is given by the directional wave spectra over the ocean at all positions ( λ ′, ϕ ′) through the source S DF ( f s ). With Δ the spherical distance between source and station, and R E the Earth radius, it is _placeholder_formula_ where d A = R E 2 cos ϕ ′ d λ ′d ϕ ′ is the elementary area of the ocean surface Ω. Finally P ( λ ′, ϕ ′, f s ) is an empirical correction factor for three‐dimensional propagation effects. When P = 1 as in , the propagation of the seismic (Rayleigh) waves correspond to a vertically symmetric earth model. Several measurements with pairs of nearby stations, one on land and the other at the bottom of the ocean, have shown that the noise recorded on land can be much weaker than that recorded at the ocean bottom [ ; ]. This suggests that for land stations P is generally less than unity, probably due to the refraction of seismic waves by the ocean‐continent gradient in phase speed as well as change in group speed and ratio of energy to surface ground variance [e.g., ]. The prominence of distant versus local sources is controlled by the geometrical spreading factor 1/sin Δ and, more importantly, by the magnitude of Q. For high Q s, seismic sources from large distances can be recorded, while low Q s reduce the typical distance from which sources can be recorded. For example, taking f s = 0.15 Hz, U = 1800 m/s and a low value of Q = 100, the seismic energy is reduced by a factor 2 every 130 km. This distance is proportional to Q , and thus a high value Q = 800 will yield a significant contribution from more remote sources ( ). The local source of seismic noise S DF ( f s ) is the contribution to the vertical ground displacement spectral density, per unit distance of propagation of the seismic waves [ ] (equations 1–5 in ). This source can be expressed from the frequency‐directional ocean wave spectrum F ( f , θ ) which is often expressed as a product of the frequency spectrum E ( f ) times an angular distribution function M ( f , θ ) _placeholder_formula_ where θ are the wave propagation directions. For ease of reading, the dependence of the seismic source on λ ′ and ϕ ′ is now implicit as we only consider the local wave and seismic response properties. The local conversion from ocean waves to seismic Rayleigh waves is a function of the ratio of sound wavelength and water depth, represented by a non‐dimensional coefficient _placeholder_formula_ , _placeholder_formula_ We obtained the mode coefficients c n , as defined by , by following the procedure outlined by , which involves solving for the coupling of ocean waves and seismic waves with a uniform ocean and semi‐infinite crust. Here the model was applied with N = 1, i.e. keeping only the first two modes. shows that for a given frequency, only a narrow range of depths gives a very strong response. For ocean waves of periods 8 to 16 s, noise generation is several times larger at depths in the range 1500 to 3000 m compared to water depths less than 500 m or more than 4000 m. Taking constant water and crust densities ρ w = 1000 kg m −3 and ρ s = 2500 kg m −3 , the source is _placeholder_formula_ where β = 3000 m s −1 is the crust shear wave velocity, also assumed constant. I ( f ) is a non‐dimensional function that depends only on M ( f , θ ), _placeholder_formula_ This directional integral means that there will be noise if and only if there is some energy in opposite directions θ and θ + π and at the same frequency f . Refinement of the Pelagic and Coastal Source Classification Into Three Classes Due to the necessary presence of waves in opposing directions, only specific sea states can yield significant levels of seismic noise. Until recently, two main types of sources had been considered, generally termed ‘pelagic’ and ‘coastal’ sources. Here we rather follow the terminology of . Taking that classification backwards, for a more simple description, class III corresponds to the events in which two wave systems of distinct origin but equal wave periods run into one another, these are most typically one swell from a remote source with a locally generated wind sea [e.g., , Figure 2], but can also be two swells from two remote sources. The two storms do not need to exist at the same time, but waves from one, when traveling at the group velocity, must cross the trajectory of waves from the other ( ). The other usual source occurs at or near any reflecting ocean boundary, usually the coasts, at mainlands or islands, we will call this class II. The noise generated in this case can actually come from deep water because part of the reflected wave energy propagates back across the open ocean. In practice, significant reflection can also occur in the marginal ice zone or around icebergs [ ; ]. Wave scattering over bottom topography may also produce opposing wave trains [ ], but it only occurs in shallow water, where the conversion of wave‐induced pressure to seismic noise is very weak. Conversely, wave refraction or scattering by current gradients may broaden the wavefield in deep water [ ; ; ], and contribute to seismic noise. Based on their numerical model, proposed that the most common source in the 0.1 to 0.3 Hz seismic frequency band, albeit weak, is generated by a single wind sea system. Indeed, because of the nonlinear evolution of random waves [e.g., ; ], the directional spectrum has a very broad directional distribution, especially at frequencies a few times higher or lower than the peak frequency, so that there is always some energy in opposite directions that generate seismic noise. designated these sources as class I. Namely, noise can be generated by a perfectly stationary and uniform wind, not necessarily in a cyclonic storm as originally proposed by . This property has received little attention so far, except for high frequency waves [ , ; ]. From high frequency radar observations the energy of opposing wave trains can be estimated for wavelengths of a few tens of meters and shorter, corresponding to wave frequencies higher than 0.25 Hz [ ]. For longer waves, closer to the peak frequency, recent detailed directional wave measurements suggest that the wave spectrum is indeed broad enough [ ] to generate a significant level of noise. From a wave modeling point of view, the clean separation of seismic sources, into those due to reflection and the others, is practically impossible and meaningless. Indeed, in the Longuet‐Higgins‐Hasselmann theory, the noise source is always determined from the directional ocean wave spectrum, whatever the reason for the existence of opposing wave trains. Yet, the relative amplitude of the two opposing wave trains should vary with the cause for their existence, and we show below that different causes can produce different relationships between seismic and ocean wave spectra. Noise Level and Directional Wave Spreading The overlap integral I ( f ) in can be estimated from pressure records at depths from 15 to 300 m [ ; ] but, unfortunately, it cannot be measured by conventional wave buoys. However, buoys provide a measure of the directional spreading σ 1 ( f ) which is a measure of the width of M ( f , θ ) [e.g., ], _placeholder_formula_ where the first directional moment is _placeholder_formula_ with θ 0 ( f ) the mean wave direction at frequency f . For a narrow spectrum, σ 1 ( f ) is the standard deviation (the half‐width) of the distribution M ( f , θ ). As illustrated by and discussed in , I ( f ) can vary by several orders of magnitude with changes in the directional distribution M ( f , θ ), even if E ( f ) remains the same. This variation forbids direct and generic relationships between the significant oceanic wave height _placeholder_formula_ and the seismic sources. Namely, a strong source can occur with a relatively low wave height, and a very large wave height may give a weak seismic source. In fact σ 1 and I may also vary differently for arbitrary shapes of M. Still, I ( f ) and σ 1 ( f ) can be related to E ( f ) for a majority of real spectral shapes. Class I Generation Here we consider noise generated by wind‐sea waves only, that are forced by the local wind, assumed uniform. Following the details in the, the seismic source in can be re‐written as and we may parameterize the directional integral I ( f ) from the wave power spectrum E ( f ), giving a relationship between E ( f ) and the seismic noise spectrum F δ (2 f ) in the form _placeholder_formula_ The frequency‐dependent coefficients a and b represent a proportionality coefficient, and an exponent that define a transfer function from the seismic spectrum to the wave spectrum. If the directional integral I ( f ) had been constant, we would have b = 0.5. However, as detailed in , we expect b > 0.5 because I ( f ) generally decreases when E ( f ) increases. Class II Generation When coastal reflections are the sources of the opposite wave trains, we may also simplify the noise model, as proposed by . Assuming that reflection is linear, a narrow incident wavefield from direction θ m produces a back‐scattered wavefield in the opposite direction θ m + π , with a spectral density of the reflected waves reduced by a factor R o 2 ( f , θ m ) compared to the incident waves (see for details). For a wavefield that varies on scales much larger than the seismic attenuation scale UQ /(2 πf s ), the recorded seismic spectrum is then given by _placeholder_formula_ The integral is a function of the wave frequency only, similar to , equation 5]. We thus attempt to invert in the form _placeholder_formula_ where a and b are empirical coefficients that we will determine, and τ is a time shift that accounts for the travel time of waves from the center of the seismic generation area to the shoreline and back. For a linear reflection one would find b = 0.5, as used by , but we expect b > 0.5 because reflection is not linear. Indeed, the wave reflection coefficient is defined from the wave amplitudes outside of the surf zone, whereas reflection mostly occurs within the surf zone, after the wave height has been reduced by breaking. As a result, the reflection coefficient decreases when the incident wave energy increases [ ; ]. Class III Generation: Interaction of Two Wave Systems In this case, noise is produced by one swell system and the wind‐sea, driven by the local wind, or two swells. The noise source is now proportional to E 1 ( f ) E 2 ( f ) I ( f ) where E 1 ( f ) and E 2 ( f ) are the spectral densities of the two interacting wave systems, and I ( f ) is the directional integral which depends on the exact mean directions and spreads of the two wave systems. These events can produce a much stronger noise than classes I or II for a given significant wave height. already noted that, on the Oregon coast, offshore winds could produce seismic noise levels that would otherwise have been caused by waves twice as large. For classes I and II the energy levels of the opposing wave trains are related, but this is generally not the case in class III events. We expect some trends of increasing noise with increasing wave heights, in particular in the special case when the swell was generated by the same moving storm, as discussed by . One could also imagine that a background swell of more or less constant properties will allow the noise generated to be proportional to the energy of the wind sea. These relationships, however, are expected to exhibit a lot of scatter because the amplitude of swells running against a wind sea (or another swell) with the same frequency can be anything from 1 cm to 10 m. Example of Noise From Local Sources: The Berkeley Record and Central California Waves We may now estimate the local wave spectrum, offshore of San Francisco, using data from Berkeley seismic station (BKS), as done by , and compare it to that measured by the U.S. National Data Buoy Center buoy number 46013. Indeed, the analysis of the BKS by suggests that the seismic noise is attenuated with a damping factor Q of the order of 90–300, with possible even higher values at the lowest frequencies. This implies a localization of most of the seismic sources within a 150 to 250 km wide strip that extends from 36° to 45° N, from the shelf break toward the open ocean (the 50% contour in and ). The shape of this dominant source region is largely controlled by the depth‐dependent amplification coefficient _placeholder_formula_ in , as shown in , with a maximum located between 2000 and 3000 m depth for f s = 0.14 Hz, which is the peak frequency of the annual average seismic spectrum at BKS. Likewise, the sharp increase of the source level when crossing the Mendocino fracture zone northbound, at 40° N, is related to the shallower depth of the ocean bottom in that area. The source area has a rather large extent, and probably 5 to 20% of the noise energy is generated north of Cape Mendocino. Such remote coastal sources have been identified by . These sources certainly contribute to the scatter in our estimation of local wave parameters because the sea state in that area is only weakly correlated to the sea state at the 46013 buoy. For example, using 3‐hourly data for the year 2008, the correlation of H s recorded at the buoy 46050 (located 30 km from shore at 44° N) with the record at 46013 is r = 0.47 for the full frequency band but r = 0.74 for wave frequencies below 0.75 Hz. Seismic Data Processing We processed seismic records into 4‐hour blocks by averaging spectra obtained over 512 s segments. The seismic data are shifted τ = 2 hours back in time, which corresponds to a propagation of 70 km for waves with a period of 12 s, consistent with the location of the source maximum in the noise model, within 100 km from shore. , found that this time shift actually maximizes the correlation of the energy levels in ocean wave and seismic noise. The resulting spectra are averaged to a seismic frequency resolution of 0.01 Hz for f s < 0.2 Hz and 0.02 Hz otherwise, so that one frequency band from the buoy corresponds to one frequency band from the seismometer, at the double frequency and with a double bandwidth. This processing effectively averages 144 spectra for each band, thus the spectrum is estimated with 288 degrees of freedom, and an expected accuracy of ± 16% (± 0.6 dB) at the 95% confidence level [e.g., ]. The buoy data are similarly averaged over 4 hours but it consists of a succession of 20 minute records for each hour, which gives only 48 degrees of freedom at a resolution of 0.005 Hz and an expected random error of ± 40% (± 1.5 dB). Buoy data are thus intrinsically more noisy than the seismic record. In order to filter out Earthquakes and seismometer glitches, we have adapted the procedure described in , now filtering each frequency band separately. Namely, a spectral density was discarded when it jumped by a factor 10 or more over 4 hours. Here we integrated spectral wave parameters over the frequency band 0.05 to 0.18 Hz. As a result, for any time record, any missing spectral density in the seismic frequency band 0.1 to 0.36 Hz resulted in the full record being discarded. Wave Reconstruction Methods Without Classification We now attempt to retrieve the ocean wave frequency spectrum E ( f ) from the seismic noise spectrum F δ ( f s ), for f s = 2 f. This inversion of , uses the empirical in which the constants a and b are fitted. We first examine the correlation of the ocean wave and seismic spectral densities that we are trying to associate. Looking at wave measurements from buoy 46013 on , E ( f ) appears well correlated with F δ ( f s ), for f between 0.07 and 0.23 Hz. Similar results are obtained with buoy 46214 (for locations, see ). The uncertainty of the spectral estimates, 1.4 dB for the wave spectra, is clearly less than the scatter in the seismic‐to‐wave relationships shown in . There are signs that different wave directions result in different seismic energy levels. At the higher frequencies in , a cloud of orange dots stand out with wave energies relatively higher than that of blue dots that have the same seismic spectral density. These orange dots correspond to waves with a mean direction between 320 and 340 that propagate almost alongshore and for which reflection is expected to be weaker, giving a weaker seismic noise. However, this trend is not very clear, and could also be contaminated by remote sources. We will thus ignore the possible dependence of a and b on θ m . There are, in general, a significant number of outliers with low wave energy. These are likely due to non‐local seismic sources that dominate the BKS record when the local waves are very small. We therefore exclude the lowest 10% values of E ( f ) and fit a linear relationship between the logarithms of the two spectral densities, as illustrated by the solid lines in . The fitted slopes give an exponent b that is systematically greater than 0.5, as expected from our analysis in . That larger b will increase the range of our estimates of wave energy. The equivalent significant wave height estimated from the seismic spectrum is given by _placeholder_formula_ When reconstructing the wave spectra and significant wave heights, as shown in , a constant exponent b = 0.5 tends to give a limited range of values, with minima overestimated in summer and maxima underestimated in general. A frequency‐dependent b appears better suited for the reconstruction of extreme events. For example, on January 8, the estimated significant wave height ( H s ) reaches 9.1 m, in close agreement with the observations. gives error statistics for the reconstruction using various methodological refinements described below. The better quality of reconstructions with a frequency‐dependent b is also demonstrated by the smaller errors on the mean periods, with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 10.4% instead of 12.4%. This smaller error shows that the spectral distribution of the energy is in better agreement with the observations. Variability of Empirical Parameters With Noise Generation Classes A striking feature of our analysis is the seasonal variation of the exponent b in , as shown in . We interpret this as a seasonal shift in the dominant class of noise generation, linked to seasonal patterns of winds and waves. This feature is robust because similar results are obtained when reconstructing data for the other buoy (number 46214), and the variation of b is stable for frequencies at which the correlation between spectral level time series is highest. analyzed that, in summer, dominant waves off this part of the coast are driven by along‐shore winds, with a typical direction from 320°. This along‐shore wind sea is hardly reflected by the shoreline and thus the directional integral I ( f ) is simply given by the directional spectrum of a single wind sea in an unbounded ocean. Logically, the noise model of predicts that class I generation dominates in summers. This is illustrated by , in which the thick green curve (modeled noise without reflection), follows very well the blue curve (observations) from May to mid‐October. The fact that the green curve is almost on top of the red curve (full model including reflection) means that, according to the model, coastal reflection has no significant effect on the seismic noise sources. In contrast, during winter months, the wind and wave orientations yield stronger reflection at the coast, which makes class II the dominant noise generation pattern. Besides this seasonal variation, a few other outstanding events with high noise level are apparently not related to shoreline reflection but are instead strong class III generation events, which leads to an overestimation of the wave height (blue stars in ). For example, the erroneously high waves estimated on January 26 (blue star in ) correspond to a complex marine weather situation, with heavy swells opposing strong local wind‐seas (Figure 14 in ). The seismic root mean square displacement δ reached 2 μ m, the second largest noise event in 2008, although wave heights at buoy 46013 did not exceed 4.8 m, much less than the seismic estimate of 7.2 m ( ) when using b ( f ) adjusted for the first 20 days of the year, or 10.1 m when b ( f ) is adjusted for the month of December. In this event, the noise model without reflection reproduces very well the observed seismic noise, which means that the effect of coastal reflection is negligible. The difference between class I and class II is less pronounced, but still the empirically fitted exponent b varies from 0.6 for class II to 0.9 for class I. Wave Reconstruction Based on Noise Classification We now use our classification for improving the estimation of sea state parameters. The highest correlation between observed and estimated wave heights ( r = 0.91 for 4‐hourly values) is obtained when we eliminate class III events before estimating the exponent b , and do not include these events in the reconstruction of wave heights. For daily‐mean values the correlation is as large as 0.93 with a normalized RMS error of 16.5%. For this, we have defined class III‐dominated records as cases for which the noise model without reflection predicts a r.m.s. seismic displacement δ noref larger than 0.5 μ m at BKS, using U = 1.8km/s Q = 90, P = 1 (see ). Similar results are obtained with Q = 300, P = 0.28 and the combination of the 0.16° and 0.5°‐resolution models. With this definition, 3.6% of the time series are dominated by class III generation. In practice there is often some class II and class I generation from some regions of the ocean at the same time as class III in other regions. Yet this simple criterion serves our purpose of removing the largest outliers in a systematic way. This procedures does not remove weaker remote signals that may actually be due to any class of noise generation, such as the Atlantic storms recorded in Southern California and discussed by and . It would certainly be interesting to investigate possible systematic deviations associated with the presence of strong remote class II sources, in particular along the Oregon coast. This analysis is left for future studies. Based on our previous seasonal analysis we have assumed that class I dominates in summer (June to September) and class II dominates for other months. We thus take the averages of a ( f ) and b ( f ) for these two seasons, and apply either the winter or summer set of coefficients in . The difference between class I and class II is significant: if the same coefficients are applied for the entire year the correlation is limited, for the 4‐hourly time series, to 0.89 with summer coefficients and 0.90 with winter coefficients ( ). After calibrating our empirical model on the year 2008, we have applied it on other years, as illustrated on for the year 1994. In practice the buoy spectra for the year 1994 have a coarser frequency resolution and more limited frequency range, and the 2008 empirical model was estimated on similarly coarsened 2008 data. The year 1994 is particular with a low level of long period swells, resulting in shorter mean periods, and much more frequent significant sources of noise that, according to the model, are not related to coastal reflection. Yet the empirical model for 2008 reproduces well the observed wave heights on average. The definition of class III ( δ noref > 0.5 μ m) still leaves too many outliers that are effectively removed by redefining class III as δ noref > 0.1 μ m, but then a large fraction of the time series is lost. This example suggests that the retrieval of extreme wave statistics from seismic noise will likely require other techniques, such as proposed by for Hurricanes, but it suggests that the average sea state can be well reproduced by our simple method. In summary, it is possible to reconstruct wave parameter time series with random errors that are comparable to those of uncalibrated numerical wave models forced by re‐analysis winds ( ). More interestingly, the wave parameters have more stable and smaller biases, compared to uncalibrated numerical wave models. Seismic Noise From Strong Remote Sources Sea state estimation is more complex when seismic stations record noise from a large part of an ocean basin. First of all, no single wave buoy is representative of the sea states that contribute to the recorded seismic noise, so that it is not simple to define wave observations for calibration. Secondly, the sources may be generated by a much wider range of sea states, including many class III events, so that empirical seismic‐ocean wave relationship can be less robust. Still, the recorded seismic level may be linked with some measure of the wave energy over the area of noise generation. We take two examples, one from the North Pacific and another from the North Atlantic. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Kipapa (KIP, Oahu, Hawaii) Based on the model, a disk with radius 1000 km around KIP is expected to contain only half the sources seen by the station. This model was verified using higher resolution grids, down to 500 m along the shoreline with a finite element mesh similar to the one used by . The model underestimates the seismic noise level for f s < 0.16 Hz, probably due to an underestimation of coastal reflections by a constant coefficient. In order to test the relationship between wave heights and seismic noise, we use satellite altimeter data. These data are very sparse is time, but in the 50% source region and for the year 2008, there is at least one pass every day by one of the three satellites, Jason‐1, Envisat, and Geosat‐Follow‐On. Starting from the source of seismic noise given by , we integrate over the dominant noise frequency band, _placeholder_formula_ This time‐dependent integrated noise source is then used to define constant weights _placeholder_formula_ where i is a time index, and N are the number of time steps. Here we sum over the entire year so that N = 2190. Using these time‐independent weights, we now obtain an estimate of the daily averaged wave height _placeholder_formula_ We find that 〈 H s 〉 is highly correlated with the daily mean recorded seismic displacement 〈 δ rms 〉 ( ). A good estimator of North Pacific wave heights is _placeholder_formula_ The large 1.4 m offset in is likely related to the high level of background swell energy that, by itself, has only a small contribution to the noise through the reflection at the shorelines. The otherwise linear relationship may be a bit surprising given that the analysis of noise events for KIP shows that many large noise events belong to class III with the interaction of two independent wave systems (e.g., Figure 11 of ). Although a higher sea state generally gives a higher seismic noise, this is only true if the directional properties of ocean waves do not vary too strongly. This variation of the directional properties is the likely cause of the scatter between recorded noise and average wave heights. Replacing the satellite‐derived wave heights by the results of the numerical wave model of , with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree in longitude and latitude and a time step of three hours, we find that the full space‐time coverage of the model produces only a marginally better correlation with the seismic noise ( ). From this we conclude that the uncertainty in the estimation of sea state parameters is real, and not an artifact of the limited sampling of the satellite data used for validation. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Eskdalemuir (ESK, Scotland) In the North Atlantic, there is also ample evidence for a correlation of sea states and seismic noise [ , ], but this has usually been investigated by correlating time series of one seismic station with wave data from a single point. Here we use an area‐averaged wave height based, again, on the expected spatial distribution of seismic sources from the model ( ), and we analyze the seismic record of the ESK station. Because we expect that the noise sources for ESK have a smaller spatial extension than for KIP, the altimeter sampling error becomes more important and we prefer to compare modeled wave heights with noise energy levels. The correlation between modeled wave heights and the seismic RMS displacement at ESK is r = 0.84, compared to 0.81 using altimeter data ( ). The daily mean wave height thus explain at least r 2 = 70% of the variance in seismic noise amplitude at ESK. However, recorded RMS ground displacements are more tightly correlated with modeled noise using the model with a seismic wave damping factor Q = 300, Rayleigh group velocity U = 1.8km/s, and propagation factor P = 0.842. For a smaller time step of 3 hours the correlation is already as high as 0.95 as shown on . This difference between 0.84 and 0.95 must be due to the variability in the directional wave distributions that change the values of I ( f ) so that the same wave energy can give very different seismic noise levels. At any given time, the noise comes from a limited area within all the possible source locations seen over the year. The possible interpretation of the noise as an area average is thus misleading. Understanding and possibly parameterizing the variability of I ( f ) will thus be needed to arrive at more accurate sea state estimations from seismic noise. This may be achieved by a seismic array analysis, as performed by , which provides a time‐varying spatial distribution of the field of noise sources. Summary and Perspectives Previous empirical estimation methods for deriving ocean wave parameters from seismic noise were based on a priori relationships between wave and seismic noise spectra. Using a numerical model for seismic noise we were able to show that the wave to noise transfer function is generally complex, due to the role of the directional distribution of wave energy. Our first conclusion is that it is paramount to have a basic knowledge of the spatial distribution of the noise sources that contribute to the record at a given seismic station. This is where the direct numerical noise model is most useful. Some stations, most notably in Hawaii, record noise that was probably generated in a large portion of an ocean basin, while others only record noise mostly generated over a nearby ocean area. The most common situation is intermediate, as we have found for many stations on mid‐oceanic islands. In the case where the seismic station record is dominated by local sources, it is relatively simple to correlate the seismic spectra with data from one representative point in the ocean, and two main situations emerge which can lead to simplified and invertible transfer functions for noise generation dominated by classes I and II. When the presence of opposite wave directions is due to coastal reflection, as considered by and , noise level at any frequency is well correlated with the wave spectral density at half that frequency, to an exponent b ≃ 0.7. The departure of this exponent from 0.5 is due to the general decrease of reflection coefficients when wave energy increases. In some particular settings when dominant winds blow alongshore, such as off Central California in summers, wave reflection has little to do with noise generation. Noise then apparently results from the broad directional distribution of the wind‐sea, which contains enough energy in opposing directions to explain the observed seismic noise. In this case, the noise spectrum is almost proportional ( b ≃ 0.9) to the wave spectrum at half the seismic frequency, which means that the directional integral I in the noise generation varies almost like the inverse of the wave energy. In the case of Central California, these two situations are typical of winters and summers, respectively, and a numerical noise model, or some information on wind direction can be used to make a fine discrimination between the two cases. Some kind of noise model will be most relevant for finding, in the noise record, the third class of noise generation, that provides intense noise level when two independent wave systems with opposing directions and same frequency coexist. These events can lead to strong overestimations of wave heights. Once they are removed, the correlation between measured daily mean wave heights and estimates from the seismic station can be as high as 0.93. These improvements in the wave reconstruction can be applied to investigate past wave climates more accurately. Yet, the investigation of extreme events should be considered with caution due to possible class III contamination. For seismic stations that appear to be representative of a large oceanic area, due to a weaker seismic attenuation or a wider spatial distribution of sources, data from a single seismic station can be related to an area‐averaged wave height. This is the case of North‐Western European stations and all the oceanic island stations that we have investigated (in Azores, Falkland Islands, Martinique, Reunion, Easter Island, French Polynesia). For these, the larger variability of wave directional properties across the source area results in a relatively larger scatter. Estimated wave heights are correlated with observed or modeled wave heights, but linear correlation coefficients are typically less than 0.88 for daily mean values. For all seismic stations, we expect that seismic‐derived wave heights averaged over time periods of one month or one year, or results of direct seismic modeling, as done by , can be useful datasets for correcting the slow drift of numerical wave models.
