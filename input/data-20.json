[{"id":0,"value":"Introduction Since the early days of seismology, the ubiquitous noise with periods 5 to 10 s has been clearly associated to ocean wave activity (for a historical account, see ). The corresponding ground motions have vertical excursions of the order of a few micrometers, hence their usual name microseisms. The detailed relationship between microseisms and ocean waves was only clarified much later with the observation by that the dominant frequency of microseisms is the double of the dominant ocean wave frequencies and follows its changes, suggesting that partial standing waves could be the origin of the recorded noise. The theoretical works of on the pressure induced by partially standing waves was the missing link that led to propose the first plausible theory of seismic noise generation as seismic Rayleigh waves generated by surface gravity waves in deep water. The theory was generalized to random waves by . The lack of a theoretical understanding did not prevent various propositions for using seismic noise as a source of information on ocean storms and weather, or for wave forecasting [ ; ], and a practical use of wave‐measuring devices based on seismometers eventually emerged [ ]. Yet, by the 1980s, ocean technology allowed routine wave measurements by buoys at sea, making the seismic ‘wavemeter’ almost obsolete. Further, satellite altimeters and synthetic aperture radars have provided routine and accurate measurements over the entire globe since 1991 [e.g., ; ]. The coarse space‐time and spectral coverage provided by satellites leaves an important potential use for seismometer‐based techniques in areas where in situ measurements are inexistent or not available [e.g., ]. The presence of low‐frequency energy in seismic records is a clear indication of long period waves associated with the most severe storms, as shown by and and can be used to investigate extreme wave events. Also numerical wave models need to be corrected for time‐dependent biases that are caused by the time‐dependent errors in the winds used as input [e.g., ]. Finally, seismic noise is related to the poorly known directional distribution of wave energy [e.g., ], and is also uniquely sensitive to very long period swells and their fore‐runners, with periods longer than 20 s, that are the fingerprints of the most severe storms [ ; ]. There is thus a need for understanding the seismic data for the analysis of ocean wave properties. Beyond the estimation of present sea states, the reconstruction of past time series of ocean wave parameters has emerged as a new possible application. Old seismographs go back to the early 20th century, which is 80 years before our modern age of space‐based measurements of ocean waves. , analyzed seismic noise variability at stations around the North Atlantic, from 1906 to 1980, to find evidence of a solar cycle in the the storm climate. He concluded that there is an 11‐year cycle in the seismic noise. Looking at his time series with our modern eyes, we rather see a correlation of noise levels with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Unfortunately details about the seismic data processing are missing to further verify that work. This quest for a quantitative link between wave climate and seismic noise has been taken up by others, with noteworthy efforts by for California, and for the North‐East Atlantic, while the analysis of many seismic records around the word indicate upward trends in seismic noise levels that was interpreted as an increase in ocean wave heights [ ]. Based on ocean wave buoy measurements, some skill was shown for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height ( H s ) over a few month period for Central California. the correlation was probably r ( H s ) > 0.8 for hourly time series, with Pearson's linear correlation for a quantity X defined by _placeholder_formula_ where the overbar denotes the arithmetic average, and X obs and X mod are the observed and modeled series. For the North Atlantic, a numerical wave model was used to find a significant correlation ( r = 0.71) for 6‐hourly time series between winter waves in various regions of the North‐East Atlantic, and noise levels at the Hamburg seismic station [ ]. Yet, with that correlation, seismic noise explains only half of the wave model variance ( r 2 = 0.5), and this was only applied to winters. It is thus premature to use results of these earlier studies to conclude on the general feasibility of wave estimation at other locations. Further, the retrieval of sea state parameters is not guaranteed beyond the seasonal time series that were studied. Thus, either for present‐day or historical wave reconstruction, there is a clear need for defining the conditions in which wave parameters can be estimated from seismic data, and to explore the systematic differences in sea states that may yield different seismic responses. The goal of the present paper is to extend these previous studies toward robust and generic methods for estimating sea state parameters from seismic noise. For this, we build upon the recent improvement in numerical wave models [ ; ], and the resulting good performance of a direct model of seismic noise. Seismic noise model results are well correlated with observed root mean square vertical ground displacements amplitudes. (hereinafter ASSM) obtained correlations higher than 0.85 for 4‐hourly seismic data over the entire year. also independently verified the location of the sources with the measured polarization directions of Rayleigh waves. This model may thus be used to guide the interpretation of seismic noise records, especially for estimating the locations of the noise sources and thus the locations where sea state parameters may be retrieved. However, this kind of model does not include three‐dimensional seismic propagation effect and may fail to explain the noise recorded at some seismic stations. In particular, it is important to recognize that several publications, most conspicuously the analysis of typhoon Ioke by , Figure S2] failed to find evidence of seismic noise propagation as surface (Rayleigh) waves from deep water to land. Along this line, many published analyses of seismic data interpret high noise levels from some direction that intersects the coastline as evidence for the importance of the coast in the generation of this noise [ ; ; ]. Others interpreted their measurements as evidence of this deep water to land propagation [ ; ; ; ]. From observations alone it is clearly impossible to decide on the position of one or several sources along a great circle in a given back‐azimuth. This is where a numerical model provides interesting additional quantitative information by estimating the plausible energy levels of the sources at each point in the ocean. Because of that controversy, we discuss below the quality of the model and the resulting uncertainties on the location of modeled noise sources. Our numerical model supports that there are plausible sources of Rayleigh waves generated in deep water that occasionally dominate the signal recorded at land‐based stations, including stations in California. These modeled deep sources occur systematically at the same time as the largest outliers in the correlation of wave heights and seismic noise levels. We shall thus use these modeled sources as a proxy for outliers in order to reduce our errors on wave height estimation. After a review of the underlying theory in , we will discuss, in , why and how seismic noise correlates with sea state parameters for seismic stations dominated by nearshore seismic noise sources, with or without wave reflection at the shoreline. In we explore the case of seismic stations that record noise generated in large areas. In both cases we propose a method for the reconstruction of time series of the significant wave height. Wave‐Noise Relations Expected From Theory General Considerations Ocean waves are known to generate microseisms via at least two distinct generation mechanisms. Primary microseisms, with a frequency equal to the ocean wave frequency, are only generated on sloping shallow topography in coastal areas [ ]. Here we only consider the secondary microseisms, which are far more energetic and generated over large regions of the ocean. They appear when ocean wave trains with nearly opposite directions and identical frequency f are superimposed [ ; ], which makes noise at the double frequency (DF) f s = 2 f. Following , we neglect changes in seismic group velocity U along their propagation path. We further assume that seismic waves are damped with a quality factor Q , such that, for a given seismic station, UQ is a constant for all the dominant seismic modes recorded by a given seismometer. The seismic noise power spectrum F δ recorded on the vertical component at a station of longitude λ and latitude ϕ on the Earth's surface is given by the directional wave spectra over the ocean at all positions ( λ ′, ϕ ′) through the source S DF ( f s ). With Δ the spherical distance between source and station, and R E the Earth radius, it is _placeholder_formula_ where d A = R E 2 cos ϕ ′ d λ ′d ϕ ′ is the elementary area of the ocean surface Ω. Finally P ( λ ′, ϕ ′, f s ) is an empirical correction factor for three‐dimensional propagation effects. When P = 1 as in , the propagation of the seismic (Rayleigh) waves correspond to a vertically symmetric earth model. Several measurements with pairs of nearby stations, one on land and the other at the bottom of the ocean, have shown that the noise recorded on land can be much weaker than that recorded at the ocean bottom [ ; ]. This suggests that for land stations P is generally less than unity, probably due to the refraction of seismic waves by the ocean‐continent gradient in phase speed as well as change in group speed and ratio of energy to surface ground variance [e.g., ]. The prominence of distant versus local sources is controlled by the geometrical spreading factor 1/sin Δ and, more importantly, by the magnitude of Q. For high Q s, seismic sources from large distances can be recorded, while low Q s reduce the typical distance from which sources can be recorded. For example, taking f s = 0.15 Hz, U = 1800 m/s and a low value of Q = 100, the seismic energy is reduced by a factor 2 every 130 km. This distance is proportional to Q , and thus a high value Q = 800 will yield a significant contribution from more remote sources ( ). The local source of seismic noise S DF ( f s ) is the contribution to the vertical ground displacement spectral density, per unit distance of propagation of the seismic waves [ ] (equations 1–5 in ). This source can be expressed from the frequency‐directional ocean wave spectrum F ( f , θ ) which is often expressed as a product of the frequency spectrum E ( f ) times an angular distribution function M ( f , θ ) _placeholder_formula_ where θ are the wave propagation directions. For ease of reading, the dependence of the seismic source on λ ′ and ϕ ′ is now implicit as we only consider the local wave and seismic response properties. The local conversion from ocean waves to seismic Rayleigh waves is a function of the ratio of sound wavelength and water depth, represented by a non‐dimensional coefficient _placeholder_formula_ , _placeholder_formula_ We obtained the mode coefficients c n , as defined by , by following the procedure outlined by , which involves solving for the coupling of ocean waves and seismic waves with a uniform ocean and semi‐infinite crust. Here the model was applied with N = 1, i.e. keeping only the first two modes. shows that for a given frequency, only a narrow range of depths gives a very strong response. For ocean waves of periods 8 to 16 s, noise generation is several times larger at depths in the range 1500 to 3000 m compared to water depths less than 500 m or more than 4000 m. Taking constant water and crust densities ρ w = 1000 kg m −3 and ρ s = 2500 kg m −3 , the source is _placeholder_formula_ where β = 3000 m s −1 is the crust shear wave velocity, also assumed constant. I ( f ) is a non‐dimensional function that depends only on M ( f , θ ), _placeholder_formula_ This directional integral means that there will be noise if and only if there is some energy in opposite directions θ and θ + π and at the same frequency f . Refinement of the Pelagic and Coastal Source Classification Into Three Classes Due to the necessary presence of waves in opposing directions, only specific sea states can yield significant levels of seismic noise. Until recently, two main types of sources had been considered, generally termed ‘pelagic’ and ‘coastal’ sources. Here we rather follow the terminology of . Taking that classification backwards, for a more simple description, class III corresponds to the events in which two wave systems of distinct origin but equal wave periods run into one another, these are most typically one swell from a remote source with a locally generated wind sea [e.g., , Figure 2], but can also be two swells from two remote sources. The two storms do not need to exist at the same time, but waves from one, when traveling at the group velocity, must cross the trajectory of waves from the other ( ). The other usual source occurs at or near any reflecting ocean boundary, usually the coasts, at mainlands or islands, we will call this class II. The noise generated in this case can actually come from deep water because part of the reflected wave energy propagates back across the open ocean. In practice, significant reflection can also occur in the marginal ice zone or around icebergs [ ; ]. Wave scattering over bottom topography may also produce opposing wave trains [ ], but it only occurs in shallow water, where the conversion of wave‐induced pressure to seismic noise is very weak. Conversely, wave refraction or scattering by current gradients may broaden the wavefield in deep water [ ; ; ], and contribute to seismic noise. Based on their numerical model, proposed that the most common source in the 0.1 to 0.3 Hz seismic frequency band, albeit weak, is generated by a single wind sea system. Indeed, because of the nonlinear evolution of random waves [e.g., ; ], the directional spectrum has a very broad directional distribution, especially at frequencies a few times higher or lower than the peak frequency, so that there is always some energy in opposite directions that generate seismic noise. designated these sources as class I. Namely, noise can be generated by a perfectly stationary and uniform wind, not necessarily in a cyclonic storm as originally proposed by . This property has received little attention so far, except for high frequency waves [ , ; ]. From high frequency radar observations the energy of opposing wave trains can be estimated for wavelengths of a few tens of meters and shorter, corresponding to wave frequencies higher than 0.25 Hz [ ]. For longer waves, closer to the peak frequency, recent detailed directional wave measurements suggest that the wave spectrum is indeed broad enough [ ] to generate a significant level of noise. From a wave modeling point of view, the clean separation of seismic sources, into those due to reflection and the others, is practically impossible and meaningless. Indeed, in the Longuet‐Higgins‐Hasselmann theory, the noise source is always determined from the directional ocean wave spectrum, whatever the reason for the existence of opposing wave trains. Yet, the relative amplitude of the two opposing wave trains should vary with the cause for their existence, and we show below that different causes can produce different relationships between seismic and ocean wave spectra. Noise Level and Directional Wave Spreading The overlap integral I ( f ) in can be estimated from pressure records at depths from 15 to 300 m [ ; ] but, unfortunately, it cannot be measured by conventional wave buoys. However, buoys provide a measure of the directional spreading σ 1 ( f ) which is a measure of the width of M ( f , θ ) [e.g., ], _placeholder_formula_ where the first directional moment is _placeholder_formula_ with θ 0 ( f ) the mean wave direction at frequency f . For a narrow spectrum, σ 1 ( f ) is the standard deviation (the half‐width) of the distribution M ( f , θ ). As illustrated by and discussed in , I ( f ) can vary by several orders of magnitude with changes in the directional distribution M ( f , θ ), even if E ( f ) remains the same. This variation forbids direct and generic relationships between the significant oceanic wave height _placeholder_formula_ and the seismic sources. Namely, a strong source can occur with a relatively low wave height, and a very large wave height may give a weak seismic source. In fact σ 1 and I may also vary differently for arbitrary shapes of M. Still, I ( f ) and σ 1 ( f ) can be related to E ( f ) for a majority of real spectral shapes. Class I Generation Here we consider noise generated by wind‐sea waves only, that are forced by the local wind, assumed uniform. Following the details in the, the seismic source in can be re‐written as and we may parameterize the directional integral I ( f ) from the wave power spectrum E ( f ), giving a relationship between E ( f ) and the seismic noise spectrum F δ (2 f ) in the form _placeholder_formula_ The frequency‐dependent coefficients a and b represent a proportionality coefficient, and an exponent that define a transfer function from the seismic spectrum to the wave spectrum. If the directional integral I ( f ) had been constant, we would have b = 0.5. However, as detailed in , we expect b > 0.5 because I ( f ) generally decreases when E ( f ) increases. Class II Generation When coastal reflections are the sources of the opposite wave trains, we may also simplify the noise model, as proposed by . Assuming that reflection is linear, a narrow incident wavefield from direction θ m produces a back‐scattered wavefield in the opposite direction θ m + π , with a spectral density of the reflected waves reduced by a factor R o 2 ( f , θ m ) compared to the incident waves (see for details). For a wavefield that varies on scales much larger than the seismic attenuation scale UQ /(2 πf s ), the recorded seismic spectrum is then given by _placeholder_formula_ The integral is a function of the wave frequency only, similar to , equation 5]. We thus attempt to invert in the form _placeholder_formula_ where a and b are empirical coefficients that we will determine, and τ is a time shift that accounts for the travel time of waves from the center of the seismic generation area to the shoreline and back. For a linear reflection one would find b = 0.5, as used by , but we expect b > 0.5 because reflection is not linear. Indeed, the wave reflection coefficient is defined from the wave amplitudes outside of the surf zone, whereas reflection mostly occurs within the surf zone, after the wave height has been reduced by breaking. As a result, the reflection coefficient decreases when the incident wave energy increases [ ; ]. Class III Generation: Interaction of Two Wave Systems In this case, noise is produced by one swell system and the wind‐sea, driven by the local wind, or two swells. The noise source is now proportional to E 1 ( f ) E 2 ( f ) I ( f ) where E 1 ( f ) and E 2 ( f ) are the spectral densities of the two interacting wave systems, and I ( f ) is the directional integral which depends on the exact mean directions and spreads of the two wave systems. These events can produce a much stronger noise than classes I or II for a given significant wave height. already noted that, on the Oregon coast, offshore winds could produce seismic noise levels that would otherwise have been caused by waves twice as large. For classes I and II the energy levels of the opposing wave trains are related, but this is generally not the case in class III events. We expect some trends of increasing noise with increasing wave heights, in particular in the special case when the swell was generated by the same moving storm, as discussed by . One could also imagine that a background swell of more or less constant properties will allow the noise generated to be proportional to the energy of the wind sea. These relationships, however, are expected to exhibit a lot of scatter because the amplitude of swells running against a wind sea (or another swell) with the same frequency can be anything from 1 cm to 10 m. Example of Noise From Local Sources: The Berkeley Record and Central California Waves We may now estimate the local wave spectrum, offshore of San Francisco, using data from Berkeley seismic station (BKS), as done by , and compare it to that measured by the U.S. National Data Buoy Center buoy number 46013. Indeed, the analysis of the BKS by suggests that the seismic noise is attenuated with a damping factor Q of the order of 90–300, with possible even higher values at the lowest frequencies. This implies a localization of most of the seismic sources within a 150 to 250 km wide strip that extends from 36° to 45° N, from the shelf break toward the open ocean (the 50% contour in and ). The shape of this dominant source region is largely controlled by the depth‐dependent amplification coefficient _placeholder_formula_ in , as shown in , with a maximum located between 2000 and 3000 m depth for f s = 0.14 Hz, which is the peak frequency of the annual average seismic spectrum at BKS. Likewise, the sharp increase of the source level when crossing the Mendocino fracture zone northbound, at 40° N, is related to the shallower depth of the ocean bottom in that area. The source area has a rather large extent, and probably 5 to 20% of the noise energy is generated north of Cape Mendocino. Such remote coastal sources have been identified by . These sources certainly contribute to the scatter in our estimation of local wave parameters because the sea state in that area is only weakly correlated to the sea state at the 46013 buoy. For example, using 3‐hourly data for the year 2008, the correlation of H s recorded at the buoy 46050 (located 30 km from shore at 44° N) with the record at 46013 is r = 0.47 for the full frequency band but r = 0.74 for wave frequencies below 0.75 Hz. Seismic Data Processing We processed seismic records into 4‐hour blocks by averaging spectra obtained over 512 s segments. The seismic data are shifted τ = 2 hours back in time, which corresponds to a propagation of 70 km for waves with a period of 12 s, consistent with the location of the source maximum in the noise model, within 100 km from shore. , found that this time shift actually maximizes the correlation of the energy levels in ocean wave and seismic noise. The resulting spectra are averaged to a seismic frequency resolution of 0.01 Hz for f s < 0.2 Hz and 0.02 Hz otherwise, so that one frequency band from the buoy corresponds to one frequency band from the seismometer, at the double frequency and with a double bandwidth. This processing effectively averages 144 spectra for each band, thus the spectrum is estimated with 288 degrees of freedom, and an expected accuracy of ± 16% (± 0.6 dB) at the 95% confidence level [e.g., ]. The buoy data are similarly averaged over 4 hours but it consists of a succession of 20 minute records for each hour, which gives only 48 degrees of freedom at a resolution of 0.005 Hz and an expected random error of ± 40% (± 1.5 dB). Buoy data are thus intrinsically more noisy than the seismic record. In order to filter out Earthquakes and seismometer glitches, we have adapted the procedure described in , now filtering each frequency band separately. Namely, a spectral density was discarded when it jumped by a factor 10 or more over 4 hours. Here we integrated spectral wave parameters over the frequency band 0.05 to 0.18 Hz. As a result, for any time record, any missing spectral density in the seismic frequency band 0.1 to 0.36 Hz resulted in the full record being discarded. Wave Reconstruction Methods Without Classification We now attempt to retrieve the ocean wave frequency spectrum E ( f ) from the seismic noise spectrum F δ ( f s ), for f s = 2 f. This inversion of , uses the empirical in which the constants a and b are fitted. We first examine the correlation of the ocean wave and seismic spectral densities that we are trying to associate. Looking at wave measurements from buoy 46013 on , E ( f ) appears well correlated with F δ ( f s ), for f between 0.07 and 0.23 Hz. Similar results are obtained with buoy 46214 (for locations, see ). The uncertainty of the spectral estimates, 1.4 dB for the wave spectra, is clearly less than the scatter in the seismic‐to‐wave relationships shown in . There are signs that different wave directions result in different seismic energy levels. At the higher frequencies in , a cloud of orange dots stand out with wave energies relatively higher than that of blue dots that have the same seismic spectral density. These orange dots correspond to waves with a mean direction between 320 and 340 that propagate almost alongshore and for which reflection is expected to be weaker, giving a weaker seismic noise. However, this trend is not very clear, and could also be contaminated by remote sources. We will thus ignore the possible dependence of a and b on θ m . There are, in general, a significant number of outliers with low wave energy. These are likely due to non‐local seismic sources that dominate the BKS record when the local waves are very small. We therefore exclude the lowest 10% values of E ( f ) and fit a linear relationship between the logarithms of the two spectral densities, as illustrated by the solid lines in . The fitted slopes give an exponent b that is systematically greater than 0.5, as expected from our analysis in . That larger b will increase the range of our estimates of wave energy. The equivalent significant wave height estimated from the seismic spectrum is given by _placeholder_formula_ When reconstructing the wave spectra and significant wave heights, as shown in , a constant exponent b = 0.5 tends to give a limited range of values, with minima overestimated in summer and maxima underestimated in general. A frequency‐dependent b appears better suited for the reconstruction of extreme events. For example, on January 8, the estimated significant wave height ( H s ) reaches 9.1 m, in close agreement with the observations. gives error statistics for the reconstruction using various methodological refinements described below. The better quality of reconstructions with a frequency‐dependent b is also demonstrated by the smaller errors on the mean periods, with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 10.4% instead of 12.4%. This smaller error shows that the spectral distribution of the energy is in better agreement with the observations. Variability of Empirical Parameters With Noise Generation Classes A striking feature of our analysis is the seasonal variation of the exponent b in , as shown in . We interpret this as a seasonal shift in the dominant class of noise generation, linked to seasonal patterns of winds and waves. This feature is robust because similar results are obtained when reconstructing data for the other buoy (number 46214), and the variation of b is stable for frequencies at which the correlation between spectral level time series is highest. analyzed that, in summer, dominant waves off this part of the coast are driven by along‐shore winds, with a typical direction from 320°. This along‐shore wind sea is hardly reflected by the shoreline and thus the directional integral I ( f ) is simply given by the directional spectrum of a single wind sea in an unbounded ocean. Logically, the noise model of predicts that class I generation dominates in summers. This is illustrated by , in which the thick green curve (modeled noise without reflection), follows very well the blue curve (observations) from May to mid‐October. The fact that the green curve is almost on top of the red curve (full model including reflection) means that, according to the model, coastal reflection has no significant effect on the seismic noise sources. In contrast, during winter months, the wind and wave orientations yield stronger reflection at the coast, which makes class II the dominant noise generation pattern. Besides this seasonal variation, a few other outstanding events with high noise level are apparently not related to shoreline reflection but are instead strong class III generation events, which leads to an overestimation of the wave height (blue stars in ). For example, the erroneously high waves estimated on January 26 (blue star in ) correspond to a complex marine weather situation, with heavy swells opposing strong local wind‐seas (Figure 14 in ). The seismic root mean square displacement δ reached 2 μ m, the second largest noise event in 2008, although wave heights at buoy 46013 did not exceed 4.8 m, much less than the seismic estimate of 7.2 m ( ) when using b ( f ) adjusted for the first 20 days of the year, or 10.1 m when b ( f ) is adjusted for the month of December. In this event, the noise model without reflection reproduces very well the observed seismic noise, which means that the effect of coastal reflection is negligible. The difference between class I and class II is less pronounced, but still the empirically fitted exponent b varies from 0.6 for class II to 0.9 for class I. Wave Reconstruction Based on Noise Classification We now use our classification for improving the estimation of sea state parameters. The highest correlation between observed and estimated wave heights ( r = 0.91 for 4‐hourly values) is obtained when we eliminate class III events before estimating the exponent b , and do not include these events in the reconstruction of wave heights. For daily‐mean values the correlation is as large as 0.93 with a normalized RMS error of 16.5%. For this, we have defined class III‐dominated records as cases for which the noise model without reflection predicts a r.m.s. seismic displacement δ noref larger than 0.5 μ m at BKS, using U = 1.8km/s Q = 90, P = 1 (see ). Similar results are obtained with Q = 300, P = 0.28 and the combination of the 0.16° and 0.5°‐resolution models. With this definition, 3.6% of the time series are dominated by class III generation. In practice there is often some class II and class I generation from some regions of the ocean at the same time as class III in other regions. Yet this simple criterion serves our purpose of removing the largest outliers in a systematic way. This procedures does not remove weaker remote signals that may actually be due to any class of noise generation, such as the Atlantic storms recorded in Southern California and discussed by and . It would certainly be interesting to investigate possible systematic deviations associated with the presence of strong remote class II sources, in particular along the Oregon coast. This analysis is left for future studies. Based on our previous seasonal analysis we have assumed that class I dominates in summer (June to September) and class II dominates for other months. We thus take the averages of a ( f ) and b ( f ) for these two seasons, and apply either the winter or summer set of coefficients in . The difference between class I and class II is significant: if the same coefficients are applied for the entire year the correlation is limited, for the 4‐hourly time series, to 0.89 with summer coefficients and 0.90 with winter coefficients ( ). After calibrating our empirical model on the year 2008, we have applied it on other years, as illustrated on for the year 1994. In practice the buoy spectra for the year 1994 have a coarser frequency resolution and more limited frequency range, and the 2008 empirical model was estimated on similarly coarsened 2008 data. The year 1994 is particular with a low level of long period swells, resulting in shorter mean periods, and much more frequent significant sources of noise that, according to the model, are not related to coastal reflection. Yet the empirical model for 2008 reproduces well the observed wave heights on average. The definition of class III ( δ noref > 0.5 μ m) still leaves too many outliers that are effectively removed by redefining class III as δ noref > 0.1 μ m, but then a large fraction of the time series is lost. This example suggests that the retrieval of extreme wave statistics from seismic noise will likely require other techniques, such as proposed by for Hurricanes, but it suggests that the average sea state can be well reproduced by our simple method. In summary, it is possible to reconstruct wave parameter time series with random errors that are comparable to those of uncalibrated numerical wave models forced by re‐analysis winds ( ). More interestingly, the wave parameters have more stable and smaller biases, compared to uncalibrated numerical wave models. Seismic Noise From Strong Remote Sources Sea state estimation is more complex when seismic stations record noise from a large part of an ocean basin. First of all, no single wave buoy is representative of the sea states that contribute to the recorded seismic noise, so that it is not simple to define wave observations for calibration. Secondly, the sources may be generated by a much wider range of sea states, including many class III events, so that empirical seismic‐ocean wave relationship can be less robust. Still, the recorded seismic level may be linked with some measure of the wave energy over the area of noise generation. We take two examples, one from the North Pacific and another from the North Atlantic. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Kipapa (KIP, Oahu, Hawaii) Based on the model, a disk with radius 1000 km around KIP is expected to contain only half the sources seen by the station. This model was verified using higher resolution grids, down to 500 m along the shoreline with a finite element mesh similar to the one used by . The model underestimates the seismic noise level for f s < 0.16 Hz, probably due to an underestimation of coastal reflections by a constant coefficient. In order to test the relationship between wave heights and seismic noise, we use satellite altimeter data. These data are very sparse is time, but in the 50% source region and for the year 2008, there is at least one pass every day by one of the three satellites, Jason‐1, Envisat, and Geosat‐Follow‐On. Starting from the source of seismic noise given by , we integrate over the dominant noise frequency band, _placeholder_formula_ This time‐dependent integrated noise source is then used to define constant weights _placeholder_formula_ where i is a time index, and N are the number of time steps. Here we sum over the entire year so that N = 2190. Using these time‐independent weights, we now obtain an estimate of the daily averaged wave height _placeholder_formula_ We find that 〈 H s 〉 is highly correlated with the daily mean recorded seismic displacement 〈 δ rms 〉 ( ). A good estimator of North Pacific wave heights is _placeholder_formula_ The large 1.4 m offset in is likely related to the high level of background swell energy that, by itself, has only a small contribution to the noise through the reflection at the shorelines. The otherwise linear relationship may be a bit surprising given that the analysis of noise events for KIP shows that many large noise events belong to class III with the interaction of two independent wave systems (e.g., Figure 11 of ). Although a higher sea state generally gives a higher seismic noise, this is only true if the directional properties of ocean waves do not vary too strongly. This variation of the directional properties is the likely cause of the scatter between recorded noise and average wave heights. Replacing the satellite‐derived wave heights by the results of the numerical wave model of , with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree in longitude and latitude and a time step of three hours, we find that the full space‐time coverage of the model produces only a marginally better correlation with the seismic noise ( ). From this we conclude that the uncertainty in the estimation of sea state parameters is real, and not an artifact of the limited sampling of the satellite data used for validation. Wave Heights From Noise Recorded at Eskdalemuir (ESK, Scotland) In the North Atlantic, there is also ample evidence for a correlation of sea states and seismic noise [ , ], but this has usually been investigated by correlating time series of one seismic station with wave data from a single point. Here we use an area‐averaged wave height based, again, on the expected spatial distribution of seismic sources from the model ( ), and we analyze the seismic record of the ESK station. Because we expect that the noise sources for ESK have a smaller spatial extension than for KIP, the altimeter sampling error becomes more important and we prefer to compare modeled wave heights with noise energy levels. The correlation between modeled wave heights and the seismic RMS displacement at ESK is r = 0.84, compared to 0.81 using altimeter data ( ). The daily mean wave height thus explain at least r 2 = 70% of the variance in seismic noise amplitude at ESK. However, recorded RMS ground displacements are more tightly correlated with modeled noise using the model with a seismic wave damping factor Q = 300, Rayleigh group velocity U = 1.8km/s, and propagation factor P = 0.842. For a smaller time step of 3 hours the correlation is already as high as 0.95 as shown on . This difference between 0.84 and 0.95 must be due to the variability in the directional wave distributions that change the values of I ( f ) so that the same wave energy can give very different seismic noise levels. At any given time, the noise comes from a limited area within all the possible source locations seen over the year. The possible interpretation of the noise as an area average is thus misleading. Understanding and possibly parameterizing the variability of I ( f ) will thus be needed to arrive at more accurate sea state estimations from seismic noise. This may be achieved by a seismic array analysis, as performed by , which provides a time‐varying spatial distribution of the field of noise sources. Summary and Perspectives Previous empirical estimation methods for deriving ocean wave parameters from seismic noise were based on a priori relationships between wave and seismic noise spectra. Using a numerical model for seismic noise we were able to show that the wave to noise transfer function is generally complex, due to the role of the directional distribution of wave energy. Our first conclusion is that it is paramount to have a basic knowledge of the spatial distribution of the noise sources that contribute to the record at a given seismic station. This is where the direct numerical noise model is most useful. Some stations, most notably in Hawaii, record noise that was probably generated in a large portion of an ocean basin, while others only record noise mostly generated over a nearby ocean area. The most common situation is intermediate, as we have found for many stations on mid‐oceanic islands. In the case where the seismic station record is dominated by local sources, it is relatively simple to correlate the seismic spectra with data from one representative point in the ocean, and two main situations emerge which can lead to simplified and invertible transfer functions for noise generation dominated by classes I and II. When the presence of opposite wave directions is due to coastal reflection, as considered by and , noise level at any frequency is well correlated with the wave spectral density at half that frequency, to an exponent b ≃ 0.7. The departure of this exponent from 0.5 is due to the general decrease of reflection coefficients when wave energy increases. In some particular settings when dominant winds blow alongshore, such as off Central California in summers, wave reflection has little to do with noise generation. Noise then apparently results from the broad directional distribution of the wind‐sea, which contains enough energy in opposing directions to explain the observed seismic noise. In this case, the noise spectrum is almost proportional ( b ≃ 0.9) to the wave spectrum at half the seismic frequency, which means that the directional integral I in the noise generation varies almost like the inverse of the wave energy. In the case of Central California, these two situations are typical of winters and summers, respectively, and a numerical noise model, or some information on wind direction can be used to make a fine discrimination between the two cases. Some kind of noise model will be most relevant for finding, in the noise record, the third class of noise generation, that provides intense noise level when two independent wave systems with opposing directions and same frequency coexist. These events can lead to strong overestimations of wave heights. Once they are removed, the correlation between measured daily mean wave heights and estimates from the seismic station can be as high as 0.93. These improvements in the wave reconstruction can be applied to investigate past wave climates more accurately. Yet, the investigation of extreme events should be considered with caution due to possible class III contamination. For seismic stations that appear to be representative of a large oceanic area, due to a weaker seismic attenuation or a wider spatial distribution of sources, data from a single seismic station can be related to an area‐averaged wave height. This is the case of North‐Western European stations and all the oceanic island stations that we have investigated (in Azores, Falkland Islands, Martinique, Reunion, Easter Island, French Polynesia). For these, the larger variability of wave directional properties across the source area results in a relatively larger scatter. Estimated wave heights are correlated with observed or modeled wave heights, but linear correlation coefficients are typically less than 0.88 for daily mean values. For all seismic stations, we expect that seismic‐derived wave heights averaged over time periods of one month or one year, or results of direct seismic modeling, as done by , can be useful datasets for correcting the slow drift of numerical wave models.

Titan is tidally locked with respect to Saturn and subject to periodic tidal forcing of its interior and surface, resulting in diurnal stresses at the satellite's surface. In addition, with one hundred Titan flybys to date, the Cassini‐Huygens mission exploring the Saturnian system since 2004 has revealed the remarkable geologic diversity of Titan's surface, exhibiting a number of features morphologically similar to what is found on our own planet [e.g., Jaumann et al. , ; Coustenis and Hirtzig , ; Solomonidou et al. , ], albeit composed of different materials (ice instead of rock, hydrocarbons in different phases instead of water). The geologic surface features are partly attributed to exchange processes between the satellite's interior, its surface, and its atmosphere [ Grasset et al. , ]. From the Cassini spacecraft, Titan's landscape has been observed by multiple flybys, examining the surface expressions through radar and infrared instrumentation. The images obtained using the Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument and the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) revealed that Titan hosts a complex surface characterized by mountains, drainage networks, dunes, faults, and possibly volcanic‐like features [ Jaumann et al. , ; Lopes et al. , , ; Solomonidou et al. , , and references therein], which resemble Earth‐like geologic structures and terrains [e.g., Coustenis and Hirtzig , ]. Only a few impact craters have been identified on Titan owing to intense resurfacing [ Wood et al. , ]. Furthermore, the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIMS) on board the Cassini spacecraft provides spectral imaging of Titan's surface at specific wavelengths in the 0.8 to 5.2 μm range. These are indicative of the diversity of the geologic terrain types, which are subject to complex erosional and depositional processes. The surface properties can be inferred from such observations using narrow methane spectral “ windows” located in the near‐infrared and centered at 0.93, 1.08, 1.27, 1.59, 2.03, 2.79, and 5.00 μm, where the methane absorption is weak enough to allow for probing of the surface [ McKay et al. , ; Griffith et al. , ]. When atmospheric scattering and absorption effects are properly accounted for, information on the nature of the surface can be extracted using radiative transfer codes [e.g., Hirtzig et al. , ]. The nonspherical part of Titan's static gravitational field is predominated by spin and tidal contributions. Using different flyby geometries of the Cassini spacecraft, Iess et al. [ ] determined the polar oblateness and equatorial ellipticity of the static gravity field independently from each other. Titan's ratio of the corresponding tidal and spin gravity coefficients C 2,2 and J 2 is close to the theoretical prediction of 3/10for a synchronously rotating satellite in hydrostatic equilibrium, from which Iess et al. [ ] infer an upper bound of 0.34 for Titan's axial moment‐of‐inertia (MoI) factor. If nonhydrostatic contributions are tentatively attributed to the degree‐3 terms, Titan's MoI factor may be as low as 0.33 [see Iess et al. , ] (supporting information), which is still inconsistent with fully differentiated interior models of Titan that would produce even smaller MoI factors [e.g., Grasset et al. , ; Sohl et al. , ; Tobie et al. , ]. Nimmo and Bills [ ] explain Titan's shape or long‐wavelength topography [ Zebker et al. , ] and the small magnitude of associated gravity anomalies [ Iess et al. , ] in terms of lateral thickness variations of a conductive floating outer ice shell with isostatically compensated ice topography and about 100 km thick on average. Titan's significant orbital eccentricity and obliquity cause periodic variations of the nonspherical part of the static gravitational field resulting in diurnal stresses at the satellite's surface. These diurnal tides could play a major role for Titan's geologic surface record. For example, the formation of cycloidal features and strike‐slip faults on synchronous satellites such as Europa is attributed to diurnal tidal stresses induced by nonzero orbital eccentricity, nonzero spin‐axis obliquity, and physical librations of their outer shell being mechanically decoupled from the deep interior [ Hurford et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ]. A measure for the tide‐induced internal redistribution of mass is the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 that is related to the radial density distribution and rheological structure of Titan. Radio science data from six close flybys of the Cassini spacecraft allowed Iess et al. [ ] to infer two solutions for k 2 of 0.589 ± 0.15 and 0.637 ± 0.224 (both with 2 σ errors), respectively, corresponding to tidal variations of about 4 % relative to the static degree‐2 terms, which is consistent with the existence of a global ocean at depth. Baland et al. [ ] and Bills and Nimmo [ ] invoke the presence of an outer ice shell, mechanically decoupled from the deep interior by a subsurface ocean, as plausible explanation for Titan's notable spin axis obliquity of about 0.3° relative to the orbit pole [ Stiles et al. , , ]. In the present study, we focus on the distribution of diurnal tidal stresses at the satellite's surface and possible links to geologic surface features on Titan. In , we describe the construction of structural models of Titan's interior based on Cassini gravity data and how the corresponding tidal stress pattern at Titan's surface is calculated. Results are presented in and put into perspective with morphotectonic surface features and related geologic processes in . Finally, discusses possible connections between the diurnal tidal stress pattern and volcanic‐like and tectonic‐like surface features on Titan with implications for the satellite's habitable potential. Model Description Structural models of Titan's interior are required to satisfy the global parameters that are listed in Table . In the absence of seismological observations, gravitational field and rotational data provide important information on the satellite's radial mass distribution and rheological structure. The gravitational field and rotational data collected by the Cassini mission suggest that Titan is in almost perfect hydrostatic equilibrium with its tidal and centrifugal potential. Furthermore, the orientation of Titan's spin pole is consistent with the assumption that the satellite's outer ice shell is partly decoupled from the deep interior by a subsurface ocean (see ). Iess et al. [ ] concluded that the Cassini gravitational field observations could be explained either by incomplete separation of the primordial ice‐rock mixture or the presence of a substantially hydrated silicate core. However, the former hypothesis has been challenged by parameterized thermal evolution models, suggesting that Titan's rock content were sufficiently high to facilitate substantial melting and complete separation of the primordial ice‐rock mixture [ O'Rourke and Stevenson , ], whereas the latter requires efficient removal of long‐lived radiogenic heat sources such as potassium from the core to delay the onset of silicate dehydration [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ; Fortes , ]. In the present study, we consider hydrated silicate cores because fully differentiated interior structure models are difficult to maintain considering Titan's inferred axial moment of inertia [ Iess et al. , ]. We note that compositional details regarding the long‐term stability of hydrated silicates, e.g., the accumulation of sodium and potassium leached early in Titan's history at the ice‐rock interface during ocean freezing [ Zolotov , ; Sohl et al. , ], are not central to the present study because we are mainly interested in the outer part of Titan's mechanical structure that determines the satellite's tidal response at the surface. We here assume that Titan is close to hydrostatic equilibrium and that the satellite's present interior structure can be characterized by four chemically homogeneous reservoirs, consisting of a hydrated silicate core (), a high‐pressure pure water‐ice mantle (), and a subsurface water‐ammonia ocean overlain by a conductive floating outer ice shell composed of low‐pressure water‐ice Ih and sI methane hydrate (). The set of differential equations for mass m , moment of inertia I , gravitational acceleration g , and hydrostatic pressure P can be derived from fundamental principles: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where r is the radial distance from Titan's center, G is the gravitational constant, ω is Titan's rotational angular frequency, and ρ is the local density, which will be explained in detail further below. Throughout the silicate core and the high‐pressure water‐ice shell, we calculate the thermal structure by solving the following two differential equations for heat flux q and temperature T in thermal steady state: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where k c is the thermal conductivity and N u r is the local Nusselt number. Here the subscript r explicitly indicates that the quantity is a local function of pressure, temperature, and composition. The specific heat production rate ε is adjusted to meet Titan's surface temperature T s of 94 K. The local Nusselt number parameterizes the strength of the convective heat flux and can be expressed as [ Wagner et al. , ] _placeholder_formula_ where k v is an effective thermal conductivity due to convection [ Kimura et al. , ; Wagner et al. , ] and ∇ T S =− g α T / C P is the adiabatic temperature gradient, with the thermal expansivity α and the specific heat capacity C P . The effective thermal conductivity k v is dependent on viscosity and obtained from the modified mixing length theory developed by Sasaki and Nakazawa [ ] to model low Reynolds number flow in solid planetary bodies. The viscosity of the silicate core is adjusted such that the central temperature will not exceed a critical threshold temperature of about 900 K for silicate dehydration [e.g., Perrillat et al. , ; Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ]. The mixing length approach allows to formulate a localized stability criterion for the onset of thermal convection, which is based on the comparison between the local temperature gradient and the adiabatic temperature gradient. If the local temperature gradient is superadiabatic, k v is greater than zero, buoyant material will rise due to the density contrast to the surrounding matter, resulting in a local Nusselt number (equation ) larger than unity. If the local temperature gradient is subadiabatic, k v is zero, the fluid material is stably stratified with respect to thermal convection, and the local Nusselt number equals one. Although this treatment slightly overestimates the heat flux at very low Rayleigh numbers [ Abe , ], the extended mixing length theory has been successfully applied in previous studies [e.g., Sasaki and Nakazawa , ; Abe , ; Senshu et al. , ; Kimura et al. , , ; Tachinami et al. , ; Wagner et al. , ]. For the sake of simplicity, the thermal structure of the outer ice shell and the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean is imposed by assuming a fixed thermal gradient from the given surface temperature T s of 94 K to the temperature of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean T o that is taken to be constant. The temperature gradient is given by the ratio between the temperature contrast and the thickness of the ice shell. With that simplified approach, we also ignore the possible existence of a thin convective sublayer at the base of the outer ice shell. Successful models are required to satisfy Titan's global parameters listed in Table . While the central conditions are m (0) = 0, I (0) = 0, g (0) = 0, P (0) = P c , q (0) = 0, and T (0)≤900 K, the surface conditions are m ( R s ) = m t , _placeholder_formula_ , _placeholder_formula_ , P ( R s ) = 1.467 bar, q ( R s ) = q s , and T ( R s ) = 94 K. Furthermore, the radius of the silicate core is derived from mass balance constraints, whereas the radial extent of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean sandwiched between low‐ and high‐pressure ice shells is calculated in accordance with the phase diagram of the H 2 O‐NH 3 system. Density and Elastic Moduli The differential equations described above are dependent on the local density ρ , which can be obtained from an equation of state. Apart from the outer ice shell, the density is calculated by using Murnaghan's integrated linear equation of state [ Murnaghan , ]: _placeholder_formula_ where ρ 0 and K 0 are the density and isothermal bulk modulus at the reference pressure ( P = P 0 =0 Pa), respectively, and K ′ is the first pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus K . The isothermal bulk modulus can be assessed by expanding K to the first order in pressure P : _placeholder_formula_ K ′ is explicitly dependent on temperature in the water‐ammonia ocean and is taken constant in the silicate core, high‐pressure ice layer, and outer ice shell. Furthermore, the rigidity μ , the adiabatic bulk modulus K , and the density ρ are related to the velocities of the compressional and shear wave v P and v S , respectively, _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where we assume that the adiabatic and isothermal bulk modulus are approximately equal, i.e., K S ∼ K T = K , under the relatively low temperature and pressure conditions prevalent in the interior of Titan. For the hydrated silicate core, we apply the Guinan‐Steinberg model to calculate the pressure dependent shear modulus at depth [ Guinan and Steinberg , ]: _placeholder_formula_ where μ 0 and μ ′ are the shear modulus and its pressure derivative at zero pressure, respectively, and x denotes the compression ratio ρ / ρ 0 . The temperature dependency of the shear modulus has been omitted owing to the relatively low temperatures that must be expected in Titans interior ( T (0)≤900 K). The Guinan‐Steinberg model is a well‐established approach to predict the shear modulus of materials at high pressures. We use the Guinan‐Steinberg model in the same way as we use an equation of state (EoS) and fit it to data obtained from high‐pressure experiments or first principles calculations to determine the reference parameters for equation as listed in Table 5. Hence, the obtained relationships are only valid to the limited pressure range (up to about 5 GPa) they have been fitted for and should not be used for extrapolation beyond the fitted range. The seismic velocities v P and v S are then obtained according to equations and . Gagnon et al. [ ] measured sound wave velocities in water‐ice VI via Brillouin spectroscopy. They found the following pressure‐dependent relationships: _placeholder_formula_ _placeholder_formula_ where v P and v S are compressional and shear wave speed, respectively. We use both equations to calculate the seismic velocities within the high‐pressure water‐ice layer and obtain the depth‐dependent rigidity μ using equation . Since the shear modulus μ of a liquid vanishes, equation simplifies to the bulk sound velocity _placeholder_formula_ which we use to calculate the compressional wave velocity v P within the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean. The outermost ice shell is assumed to be composed of water‐ice Ih and sI methane hydrate. Using a linear planar fit, Helgerud et al. [ ] report equation of state and elastic parameters that are based on laboratory data: _placeholder_formula_ where F is the desired value (e.g., the local density ρ and elastic moduli K and μ ). Modeling details for each structural layer are presented in the , , and . Interfaces The interface between nearby chemical reservoirs is determined by the water‐ammonia phase diagram and Titan's global parameters as listed in Table . The thickness of the subsurface water‐ammonia ocean sandwiched between low‐ and high‐pressure ice shells is calculated in accordance with the phase diagram of the H 2 O‐NH 3 system shown in Figure . As a consequence, the intersections of the calculated local geotherm and the melting conditions for a fixed ocean temperature determine the radial extent of the chemical reservoirs within Titan's water‐ice/liquid shell above the silicate core. For the low‐pressure water‐ice (Ih), the melting temperature T m as a function of pressure P m and ammonia content χ was derived by Leliwa‐Kopystyński et al. [ ] as follows: _placeholder_formula_ where T ref is a reference temperature of 273.1 K and a , b , c , d , and e are experimentally determined fit parameters. The corresponding fit parameters for the low‐pressure melting curve of a H 2 O‐NH 3 mixture are a = 7.95 × 10 −8 K Pa −1 , b = 9.6 × 10 −17 K Pa −2 , c = 53.8 K, d = 650 K, and e = 4×10 −8 K Pa −1 [ Leliwa‐Kopystyński et al. , ]. When considering the high‐pressure phases of water‐ice (III, V, and VI), a similar parameterization relating the melting temperature T m to pressure P m and ammonia content χ is given by [ Choukroun and Grasset , , ] _placeholder_formula_ where T ref and P ref are reference values, respectively, and a , b , c , and d are fit parameters. The latter term of equation has been obtained from Figure in Choukroun and Grasset [ ]. It roughly quantifies the reduction in melting temperature of the high‐pressure water‐ice polymorphs when ammonia is added into the water liquid. We list the corresponding values with respect to the appropriate water‐ice phases in Table . The interface between the water‐ice‐dominated mantle and the silicate core is then completely constrained by the global properties of Titan described in the previous section. In other words, the radius of the core is determined from mass balance constraints and Titan's physical properties as listed in Table . Diurnal Tides and Tidal Stresses Titan is subject to time‐varying radial and librational tides exerted by Saturn on the timescale of its orbital period. Disregarding small contributions due to obliquity tides, the main tidal potential is given by [ Segatz et al. , ; Moore and Schubert , ; Wahr et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ; Hussmann et al. , ; Beuthe , ] _placeholder_formula_ where r is the radial distance from the center of Titan and ω and e are Titan's mean motion and orbital eccentricity, respectively. _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ are associated Legendre polynomials of second degree. θ and φ are colatitude and longitude with zero longitude at the sub‐Saturnian point, and t is time. Owing to the external gravitational perturbation by Saturn the equipotential surface at Titan is radially shifted by Φ e / g s with g s the surface gravity. In general, the satellite's tidal response depends on its interior structure, thermal state, tidally effective rheology, and the frequency of tidal forcing, and is parameterized in terms of the degree‐2 body tide Love numbers h 2 , k 2 , and l 2 . We assume that the satellite's outer ice shell responds elastically to the tidal forces exerted by Saturn. This assumption is justified since diurnal tidal stresses are stored mostly elastically in the cold, stagnant outermost part of the ice shell and is widely insensitive to the specific rheology and thickness of the ice shell [ Wahr et al. , ; Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , ]. We solve for the radial displacement Love number h 2 , the potential Love number k 2 , and the Shida number l 2 by numerical integration of the linearized field equations for small elastic deformations in a spherical, incompressible, and self‐gravitating body, accounting for certain continuity and boundary conditions [see Segatz et al. , ; Hussmann et al. , , and references therein]. As model inputs we use the calculated radial profiles of density and elastic moduli as described in .The ocean is modeled as an inviscid fluid layer by assuming a low rigidity and low viscosity while making sure that the tidal response is short as compared to the corresponding Maxwell time defined by the ratio of steady state viscosity and rigidity. For detailed descriptions of more general cases such as radially stratified, viscoelastic, and self‐gravitating spherical body and the solution of the equivalent elastic problem in the frequency domain, we refer the reader to Cheng and Toksöz [ ], Wahr et al. [ ], Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen [ ], and Beuthe [ ]. Since we are interested in global amplitude patterns of diurnal tidal stresses, we calculate the maximum tensile (areal) stress [ Zürn and Wilhelm , ] _placeholder_formula_ and maximum shear stress _placeholder_formula_ at Titan's surface, whereas the mean tidal stress _placeholder_formula_ is given by _placeholder_formula_ The diurnal tidal stresses σ θ θ , σ φ φ , and τ θ φ = τ φ θ are specified by the nonzero components of the stress tensor in latitudinal ( σ θ θ ), longitudinal ( σ φ φ ), and cross directions ( τ θ φ = τ φ θ ) and related to the time‐variable tidal potential Φ e at the satellite's surface (see ). Interior Structure and Tidal Stresses We have constructed 60 models of Titan's present interior structure. Shown in Figure are color‐coded thicknesses of Titan's icy crust, d c , and its subsurface water‐ammonia ocean underneath, d o , as a function of the satellite's degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 and mean moment‐of‐inertia factor MoI, respectively. In general, structural information, i.e., MoI, k 2 , and radial extent of outer ice shell (Figure a) and subsurface ocean (Figure b), is conveyed by the figure axes and color scale, whereas additional information about the bulk chemistry, i.e., NH 3 content and average core density, is encoded through symbol shape and size. In Figure a, it can be distinguished between thin (bluish), intermediate (greenish), and thick (reddish) outer ice shells. They correspond, respectively, to deep (reddish), intermediate (turquoise), and shallow (bluish) subsurface water‐ammonia oceans shown in Figure b. Furthermore, form and size of each symbol represent specific ammonia (NH 3 ) contents within the subsurface ocean and average densities of the silicate core, respectively. From top to bottom, the pyramid, square, diamond, and triangle marks denote an increase in NH 3 concentration varying among 0, 5, 15, and 25 wt %. From left to right, core density decreases with increasing symbol size. Filled symbols represent models with a water‐ice crust, while open symbols correspond to cases with a crust composed of water‐ice and methane clathrate in equal amounts by mass. The latter are shifted slightly to larger values of k 2 and MoI with respect to the former, thereby indicating that methane‐clathrate crusts tend to be denser and less rigid than pure water‐ice crust layers. This becomes even more pronounced with increasing thickness of Titan's outer ice shell. It is seen that k 2 is strongly related to both the crustal thickness d c and the subsurface ocean thickness d o , respectively. With increasing ocean density, e.g., in the presence of salty constituents and/or suspended sediment loads, valid models will be shifted to even larger k 2 values, thereby allowing for thicker outer ice shells. In terms of interior structure, we obtain similar results if the ammonia‐water ocean is replaced by a saltwater ocean with an NaCl content of 5 wt % (ocean density 1.15 g cm −3 ), similar to terrestrial oceans. Since extensive leaching of Titan's hydrated silicate core cannot be excluded, we show in Figure an example for a dense ocean composed of ammonium sulfate ((NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ) (density 1.35 g cm −3 ) based on a model proposed by Fortes et al. [ ]. Solutes leached from the hydrated silicate core (e.g., Cl − , HCO _placeholder_formula_ , SO _placeholder_formula_ , Na + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) could increase the density of Titan's subsurface water ocean. However, a number of hydrated salts would precipitate again upon ocean freezing and sink to the ocean floor. It must be also taken into account that the concentration of solutes in subsurface water oceans is probably significantly less than 10 wt % [e.g., Tobie et al. , ] with only little effect on the density of the liquid. As a consequence, melting point reduction by ammonia‐water solutions is a valid explanation to facilitate the possible existence of liquid water subsurface reservoirs on icy bodies in the outer solar system [e.g., Sohl et al. , ]. In general, models yielding thinner crusts and substantial subsurface oceans are found to correspond to larger body tide Love numbers k 2 and vice versa. Largely extended icy crusts can be ruled out, however, since models with ice shell thicknesses of more than 110 km are difficult to reconcile with the observational constraints imposed by the Cassini gravitational field data (black boxes) [ Iess et al. , , ]. In turn, valid models of Titan produce subsurface oceans that are at least 180 km thick. This is illustrated in Figure , in which we explicitly show how the calculated body tide Love numbers k 2 depend on the thicknesses of both outer ice shell and subsurface water‐ammonia ocean. It is even possible to construct valid models with subsurface oceans of about 430 km thickness, corresponding to structural models with vanishing high‐pressure water‐ice layers between the silicate core and the liquid ocean itself. In other words, in these cases the subsurface ocean were in direct contact with the silicate core with important implications for Titan's habitable potential [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ; Fortes , ]. Furthermore, inspection of the symbols and their sizes in Figure reveals that Titan's MoI factor is partly controlled by the density of the silicate core, shifting to larger MoI values with decreasing core density. For example, the satellite's moment of inertia will increase if less dense material is added to the core because of the smaller density contrast between the surface and the deep interior. In the presence of a subsurface ocean, the density distribution within the silicate core has a negligible effect on the body tide Love number k 2 , owing to the mechanical decoupling of the outer ice shell from the deep interior. Moreover, the ammonia (NH 3 ) concentration within the subsurface ocean provides bounds on the ocean temperature that are compliant with successful models of Titan's interior. The NH 3 concentration in the ocean (represented by the form of a symbol) likewise affects the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 . It is seen from inspection of Figures a and b that for lower NH 3 concentrations the symbols shift to larger values of each MoI and k 2 . For models corresponding to rather deep oceans with thicknesses of at least 370 km and relatively thin outer ice shells a few tens of kilometers thick, no firm constraints on the ocean composition (in terms of NH 3 content) can be imposed with respect to the reported 2 σ error margins of MoI and k 2 , respectively. Depending on the actual NH 3 content, ocean temperatures down to 220 K are possible for NH 3 concentrations up to 25 wt %. However, models with intermediate‐sized oceans of about 200 km depth and significant ice shells with thicknesses of about 100 km satisfy these observational constraints only if low NH 3 concentrations in the range of 0 to 5 wt % are present, corresponding to relatively warm oceans with temperatures in excess of 255 K. We consider the reference model illustrated in Figure as a plausible fiducial model of Titan's present interior structure that satisfies the 2 σ observational data of the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 based on Cassini gravity data. The model parameters are summarized in Table . The construction of the reference temperature profile requires three fixpoints, namely, the ocean temperature (prescribed), the surface temperature (94 K), and the central temperature (900 K). We then vary two core parameters—the effective specific heat production and the average viscosity—such that (i) the central temperature in the core stays below the critical temperature of silicate dehydration and (ii) the mean surface temperature of Titan is met. The calculated values of the MoI factor and the degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 are 0.34 and 0.44, respectively, commensurate with the low end of the reported 2 σ error margins of the latter [ Iess et al. , ]. The silicate core is about 2080 km in radius with an average density of 2.55 g cm −3 . This is in good agreement with the core radius range of 1980 to 2120 km and the corresponding density range of 2.57 to 2.46 g cm −3 obtained by Fortes [ ] for a broad suite of compositional models of Titan's interior. The specific heat production rate of the core is about half of that what would be expected for a chondritic bulk composition, consistent with the early leaching of radioactive isotopes [ Castillo‐Rogez and Lunine , ]. While the central pressure is 4.9 GPa, the pressure at the core‐mantle boundary is about 0.8 GPa. A significant high‐pressure water‐ice layer about 200 km in thickness with an average density of 1.3 g cm −3 is retained. For the subsurface water‐ammonia (H 2 O‐NH 3 ) ocean we obtain a thickness of about 180 km. The average ocean density is 1.1 g cm −3 . The ocean temperature is 255 K at an NH 3 content of 5 wt %. The outer ice shell is 110 km thick with an average density of 0.95 g cm −3 , in agreement with compensated floating ice shell models preferred by Nimmo and Bills [ ]. The temperature gradient across the shell is 1.4 K km −1 , rendering a surface heat flow of about 3 mW m −2 . Figure shows the global amplitude pattern of tide‐induced diurnal stresses at the surface of Titan for the reference model. It is distinguished between (i) maximum tensile stresses, σ areal , predominating in the equatorial and midlatitude regions of the sub‐ and anti‐Saturnian hemispheres (Figure a) and (ii) maximum shear stresses, τ shear , concentrated in the polar regions (Figure b). In other words, tidal stresses are more conducive to strike‐slip motion around the poles and to compression or extension at lower latitudes. The maximum diurnal tidal stresses, _placeholder_formula_ , shown in Figure c are calculated from the second invariant of the stress tensor and can be interpreted as superposition of the amplitude patterns of both tensile and shear stresses and, therefore, may serve as a measure for tide‐induced weakening of the crust layer, facilitating comparison with geologic surface feature. This suggests that tidal flexure and stress concentration are significantly enhanced in four adjacent, midlatitude zones, approximately situated between the directions of the apex and antiapex of Titan's orbital motion and that to the satellite's sub‐ and anti‐Saturnian points, respectively. Surface Geology, Morphotectonics, and Cryovolcanic Features Titan's surface hosts a large number of diverse features formed by fluvial, aeolian, impact, and possibly internal processes. From the detailed—albeit incomplete—account of the landforms seen by the Cassini‐Huygens mission so far, morphological similarities are apparent between geologic surface features observed on Earth and on Titan [ Solomonidou et al. , ]. For example, the presence of extensive dune fields [e.g., Radebaugh et al. , ] is indicative of aeolian processes predominating close to the surface, while drainage networks and lakes [ Stofan et al. , ] are likely related to precipitation and fluvial phenomena or subsurface reservoirs as part of Titan's alkanological cycle [e.g., Atreya et al. , ; Lebreton et al. , ]. Table lists reported observations of features on Titan's surface that could be related to endogenic activity. The morphologies, shapes, and locations of these surface expressions are informative about the underlying formation processes at work within the corresponding geologic terrains. It has been suggested that Titan's rigid icy crust could be assembled in the form of ice rafts reminiscent to terrestrial tectonic plates [e.g., Mitri et al. , ]. In the same vein, terrestrial phenomena like volcanism and/or the formation of linear features and drainage networks controlled by tectonics could also exist on Titan [e.g., Burr et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ]. The tectonic‐like origin of surface expressions like mountains, faults, and volcanic structures are suggestively related to ice rafts of altered densities moving on a liquid layer, thereby producing convergent or divergent surface features due to stresses caused by endogenic activity. In any event, it cannot be excluded that endogenic dynamics has played an important role for Titan's geologic activity. Additional types of surface features that are particularly interesting due to their uncertain formation history are those that seem to be surface expressions of Titan's possible internal activity, i.e., geologic structures resulting from upwelling or fracturing of the upper crust caused by endogenic dynamics. Representative features of this type are morphotectonic features [ Solomonidou et al. , ] and candidate cryovolcanic sites (Figure ). Cryovolcanism has been hypothesized on Titan as a means of replenishing methane in Titan's atmosphere [e.g., Tobie et al. , ], and it can also explain changes reported in surface brightness or morphologically volcanic‐like features [e.g., Lopes et al. , ; Soderblom et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Solomonidou et al. , ]. Other possibilities to explain these surface expressions prefer exogenic formation processes such as fluvial or lacustrine [ Barnes et al. , ; Moore and Howard , ; Moore and Pappalardo , ]. In any event, some areas on Titan's surface are likely to have exhibited brightness changes over time (cryovolcanic candidates) and/or have morphologies closely related to Earth's tectonic manifestations (e.g., mountains, faults). They are mostly located at equatorial latitudes between 30°S and 30°N and are likely associated with the surface stress field [ Soderblom et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Solomonidou et al. , ]. The mountainous regions were found to have elevations from 200 to 2000 m [ Radebaugh et al. , ; Mitri et al. , ; Lorenz et al. , ] and are characterized as mountain chains, hills, and ridges depending on their size, shape, and extension (see Table and Figure (left)). On Earth such features are mainly attributed to lateral motions of lithospheric plates, a geologic phenomenon that is largely unlikely to occur on Titan in the same fashion as it does on Earth. In spite of being a consequence of crustal movements, some blocks of mountains may have originated from impact ejecta [ Radebaugh et al. , ]. Other interesting areas on Titan are the so‐called “active” regions with reported changes in brightness and/or color over time [ Nelson et al. , ; Wall et al. , ]. In Table the characteristics of these cryovolcanic candidate sites are listed, among which are Tui Regio (20°S, 130°W), a 1500 km long flow‐like figure [ Barnes et al. , ], Hotei Regio (26°S, 78°W), a 700 km wide volcanic‐like terrain [ Soderblom et al. , ], and Sotra Patera region (15°S, 40°W) (formerly known as Sotra Facula), and currently including Mohini Fluctus, Doom Mons, and the Sotra Patera pit [ Lopes et al. , , ]. These areas together with others (see Table ) have anomalous spectral and morphological properties that are possibly caused by dynamic geologic processes [ Jaumann et al. , ; Lopes et al. , , ]. Among others, deep craters (Sotra Patera), lobate flows (Mohini Fluctus), and caldera‐like formations (in Hotei Regio) have been observed by Cassini RADAR and VIMS. In addition, VIMS data processing provided indications for brightness or surface albedo variations within a period of one to 3.5years. In analogy with terrestrial morphotectonic structures, the shape, size, and morphology of Titan's observed mountains, ridges, hills, and linear features such as faults, major fractures, and canyons probably originate through some form of compressional and extensional tectonic activity. Titan's rigid outer ice shell and the probable existence of a subsurface ocean create an analogy with terrestrial, at least surficial, plate tectonics. In this work, we have focused on the possible relations between solid body tides on Titan and observed geologic features on Titan's surface. Shown in Figure is a map including both the diurnal tidal stress and geologic information. On this map we see the morphotectonic features of Titan which are the current identified major types of tectonic‐like features (see Table ) and their distribution on the surface. These are the elevated features such as mountains (green), faults and fractures (blue), and the candidate cryovolcanic features (red). On this map is also overplotted the global amplitude pattern of maximum diurnal tidal stresses, _placeholder_formula_ , as shown in Figure c. This map reveals the correlation between features that are possibly tectonic and/or volcanic in origin and zones of intense tide‐induced surface deformation concentrated at midlatitudes. Four midlatitudes (50°S to 50°N) centered at (a) 40°, (b) 120°, (c) 230°, and (d) 310°west longitude, respectively, are the most amplified ones in terms of tidal flexure and stress accumulation, indicating zones of potentially high internal influence (Figure ). As seen in the overplotted maps, we find that most of the sites listed in Table are located within ±30°latitude from the equator in the leading hemisphere and therefore preferentially located within the strongly tidally flexed zones. This is particularly true for the mountains and the cryovolcanic candidates, while exceptions mainly concern the faults (blue dots on the map of Figure ) and a couple of highlands in the high northern latitudes around 60°N. We note that the volcanic‐like sites are concentrated in strongly tidally flexed zones as follows: Sotra Patera is located in the center of the (a) zone, confirming suggestions that rank this area as the most favorable candidate cryovolcanic region [ Lopes et al. , ]; Tui Regio is located within the limits of the (b) zone; and Hotei Regio is located on the border between these two zones of amplified tidal distortion. Discussion and Conclusions We have studied present‐day structural models of Titan's interior that are consistent with Cassini gravitational field data and simultaneously satisfy the satellite's inferred axial moment‐of‐inertia factor and degree‐2 body tide Love number k 2 at the low end of the reported error margins of the latter [ Iess et al. , ]. In order to explain larger k 2 values than the average of the measured k 2 , one may invoke ad hoc density hypotheses such as (i) relatively dense liquids [e.g., Mitri et al. , ] or (ii) mushy lower ice layers, but their possible existence is not supported by observations at this point. The first class of models has the difficulty that oceans composed of almost saturated salty solutions or suspensions were required, resulting in the precipitation of dense or suspended constituents over time. On the other hand, the existence of a mushy ice layer on Titan would result in a phase shift between primary and secondary tidal potential that to our knowledge is not supported by Cassini gravity field observations. More accurate time‐variable gravity field data are required to resolve this issue. Amplitude patterns of both diurnal tidal tensile and shear stresses and their superposition were calculated and are compared to the spatial distribution of tentative volcanic‐like and tectonic‐like surface features on Titan. Though alternative explanations prefer an exogenic origin [e.g., Moore and Pappalardo , ], the correlation between the tidal stress patterns illustrated in Figure and the surface features seen on Titan may rather suggest an endogenic origin of the latter. The calculated diurnal tidal stresses are on the order of a few tens of kPa, comparable to the magnitude of maximum possible nonhydrostatic deviatoric stresses on Titan [ Gao and Stevenson , ], but the accumulation of tectonic stresses could eventually help exceed the tensile strength of fractured ice [ Kimura et al. , ; Smith‐Konter and Pappalardo , ]. True polar wander of the spin axis due to large‐scale redistribution of mass on the surface or within the interior and nonsynchronous rotation of the decoupled shell moving slowly across the satellite's permanent tidal bulge may cause the buildup of long‐term stresses and the formation of geologic surface features on a global scale [e.g., Jara‐Orué and Vermeersen , , and references therein]. Furthermore, in the event of stress hysteresis owing to transient creep phenomena [e.g., Shoji et al. , ], the incomplete relaxation of tidal stresses could play a role for stress buildup over several tidal cycles. Similar to the tide‐induced seismicity of the Moon, episodic stress release accompanied by localized tectonic quakes may occur where a certain threshold stress limit value is exceeded. Recent laboratory experiments in the low‐temperature range below 220 K indicate that the resistence of polycrystaline water ice to tensile failure is strongly dependent on temperature, composition, grain size, and porosity [ Litwin et al. , ]. For consolidated pure ice and ice contaminated by solid impurities, tensile strength is reported to increase by a factor of a few times the commonly used value of 1 MPa, which could impede tide‐induced tectonism under Titan surface conditions. However, crustal porosity and the presence of near‐surface liquids would considerably reduce the ice resistence to fracture. Furthermore, these authors suggest that fracture toughness is more important than tensile strength in the event of low strain rates where fracture propagation rather than fracture initiation is the strength‐limiting factor. It is therefore conceivable that a porous ice crust soaked with liquids and subject to tide‐induced surface deformation would be conducive to the formation of zones of weakness near strongly tidally flexed areas as shown in Figure . The possible existence of crustal zones of weakness on Titan may cause episodic cryovolcanic activity induced by positive buoyancy through exsolution of volatiles upon decompression, and the subsequent ascent along fluid‐filled fractures in analogy to dikes [ Lopes et al. , ]. Another mechanism to promote localized cryovolcanism might be shear heating by tide‐induced strike‐slip fault motion as suggested by Nimmo et al. [ ] to explain the heat and vapor production within the tiger‐stripe regions near the south pole of Enceladus. Equally to the leading hemisphere, two near‐equatorial zones of strong tidal flexure and stress concentration are present on the trailing hemisphere. The apparent absence of cryovolcanic candidate features on the trailing hemisphere could be caused by the current observational bias toward the leading hemisphere. This is indicated in a recent multispectral map of Cassini VIMS and RADAR/SARtopo and altimetry data [ Lorenz et al. , ] that is based on extrapolation from the still relatively scarce data basis with several large gaps to be filled by future Cassini observations. Alternatively, the apparent hemispheric asymmetry of tectonic‐like and volcanic‐like features could be linked to erosional and depositional processes since Titan's surface is subject to intense resurfacing. The global distribution and characteristics of fluvial erosion on Titan indeed indicates seasonal climatic asymmetries between both hemispheres [ Langhans et al. , ]. Our findings further reveal that future Cassini observations of Titan's surface should focus on the tidally flexed regions in the trailing hemisphere and the polar areas that are more conducive to strike‐slip motions. It must be expected that these regions could bear additional marks of the satellite's endogenic activity. Titan is a dynamic satellite at present, as evidenced by the recent albedo changes observed in the Sotra Patera region and Tui Regio and the extensive surface changes spanning more than 500,000km 2 in the wake of a seasonal storm [ Turtle et al. , ]. Dynamic activity is thought to be conducive to habitable conditions on a planetary body as it allows the recycling of minerals and potential nutrients and provides localized energy sources by warm upwelling material. In a habitable environment, not only polymeric chemistry but also a fluid and semistable environment have to be present, as well as an energy source [ Schulze‐Makuch and Irwin , ]. Here we show that tidal forces are a constant and significant source of internal deformation on Titan. Furthermore, our model calculations suggest comparatively low ocean ammonia contents of less than 5 wt % and ocean temperatures in excess of 255 K, i.e., higher than previously thought, thereby substantially increasing Titan's potential for habitable locations. When addressing Titan's habitability, understanding its interior structure is of critical importance. In this study, we have adopted new laboratory data for the parameterization of the water‐ammonia (H 2 O‐NH 3 ) phase diagram [ Choukroun and Grasset , , ] to determine the sizes of Titan's bulk reservoirs (crust, ocean, and deep interior) by assuming an isothermal subsurface ocean. It is important to remember that the thicknesses of the outer ice shell and of the subsurface ocean are linked to each other through the pressure‐temperature phase relationships (phase diagram) of the water‐ammonia system. Therefore, higher ocean temperatures yield larger ocean thicknesses and thinner ice shells and vice versa. For reasonable amounts of NH 3 (< 25 wt %), the ocean temperatures of successful structural models of Titan's interior are dependent on the ammonia concentration in the ocean. Smaller ammonia concentrations lead to warmer subsurface oceans and vice versa. A thinner crust would clearly be more conducive to putative life, because it could result in frequent cryovolcanism and upwelling of ammonia‐water pulses near or onto the surface. Evidence for cryovolcanism was observed previously [ Sotin et al. , ; Lopes et al. , ; Wall et al. , ]. The diurnal tidal stresses as modeled for Titan could be large enough to result in geologic surface features: Liquid water‐ammonia outbursts on the surface of Titan would clearly be a sign of a dynamic planetary body and may also provide suitable environmental niches for life, at least on a temporary basis. As a first step, our results indicate that one should look for such manifestations at the surface to bring additional evidence for the presence of the liquid water ocean. Our modeling results also provide some constraints on the thickness of the water‐ammonia ocean. For our reference model, we obtain a large ocean of about 180 km thickness, which would provide a huge reservoir of liquid water and ammonia. However, the ocean would be sandwiched between two layers of ice (Figure a), and needed inorganic ions, which play a central role in Earth biology including redox chemistry (Fe, Cu, Mn, Co, Mo, Se, S), acid‐base catalysis (Zn, Ni), transmission and storage of energy and information (S, B, Si), and cell structure and homeostasis (Ca, Na, K), may be hard to come by [e.g., Fortes , ]. If the ammonia‐water solvent were in direct contact with the rocky core, as some models shown in Figure suggest, hydrothermal vent communities as observed on Earth and modeled for Europa [e.g., Irwin and Schulze‐Makuch , ] may represent a feasible possibility for Titan's subsurface. Our findings for a large, warm subsurface ocean with possibly a thin crust above enhance the habitability and astrobiological potential of Titan, but even more make it a special target for future exploration as an object with unique properties in our solar system.

Measurements of solar backscattered radiation at ultraviolet and visible (UV‐Vis) wavelengths from instruments such as Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), GOME‐2, Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been applied to retrieve many important atmospheric constituents including O 3 , NO 2 , HCHO, SO 2 , BrO, clouds, and aerosols [ ]. These UV‐Vis satellite observations provide valuable insight into the tropospheric composition of remote regions [ ; ; ; ; ], into trace gas emissions [ ; ; ; ; ; ], and into surface air quality [ ; ; ]. However, accurate description of the surface reflectivity is needed for retrievals of trace gases, clouds, and aerosol in the UV‐Vis. The retrieval of trace gas abundances commonly begins with a spectral fit that is applied to distinctive absorption bands in the measured reflectance spectra [ ; ]. The observed absorption is used to calculate the slant column (SC), a measure of the total amount of trace gas along the path of the backscattered sunlight captured by the satellite instrument. A slant column is converted into a vertical column (VC), the integrated column above the surface, through use of an air mass factor (AMF) such that VC = SC/AMF [ ]. The AMF accounts for the varying vertical sensitivity of the measurement, which depends on the light path through the atmosphere, the surface reflectivity, the trace gas vertical profile, clouds, and aerosols. In practice, the AMF is estimated using imperfect knowledge of these parameters and radiative transfer in the atmosphere. Previous studies have found a high sensitivity of the retrieval to surface reflectivity. estimate an error of 10%–20% in their SO 2 columns for an error of 0.02 in the surface reflectivity over land. For this same error in the surface reflectivity, estimate an error of 15% in the derived tropospheric NO 2 column for polluted scenes. For a typical scene, estimate an error of 0.02 in the cloud fraction due to an error of 0.02 in the surface reflectivity. The reflectivity of snow is an important parameter in satellite‐based estimation of surface UV irradiance [ ]. Several global climatologies of surface reflectivity have been created from long‐term data sets of measured radiances from TOMS [ ], GOME [ ], and OMI [ ]. Statistics are applied to the long‐term data set to remove the effects of clouds and aerosols from measured reflectivity. This statistical cloud screening could lead to ambiguity in the absolute surface reflectivity. The NASA A‐Train is a formation of several specialized satellites flying in close proximity which includes the instruments OMI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The wealth of information provided by these instruments over the same locations at nearly the same time grants an unprecedented opportunity to infer surface reflectivity, without statistical methods to eliminate clouds, and to evaluate the above data sets. Clouds and the surface often are modeled as opaque Lambertian reflectors for the purpose of satellite retrievals [ ]. In this approach, the wavelength specific, normalized backscattered radiance at the top of the atmosphere I TOA is given by [ , equation 6.16; ] _placeholder_formula_ where R is the Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) of the cloud or surface, I g is the total irradiance reaching the surface, γ is the transmittance of the atmosphere to reflected radiance, and S b is the fraction of the reflected irradiance (or flux) that the atmosphere scatters back toward the reflector. The independent pixel approximation is used to deal with partially cloudy scenes. In this approximation, the total observed radiance ( I Total ) is the sum of the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiances of the clear ( I clear ) and cloudy ( I cloud ) subpixels weighted by a cloud fraction ( f ). The total observed radiance is then expressed as _placeholder_formula_ For UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals, the cloud fraction is determined by comparing the observed TOA radiance to the modeled clear‐sky TOA radiance based on the climatological surface reflectivity. A deficit in the modeled TOA radiance is accounted for by clouds (which are typically more reflective than the surface). In practice, a small, highly reflective cloud and a large, semitransparent cloud with the same total reflectivity are indistinguishable. For this reason, the reflectivity of the modeled cloud is fixed and only the cloud fraction is allowed to vary. The cloud fraction (or effective cloud fraction) is thus a combination of the true geometrical cloud fraction and the cloud reflectivity. Typical choices for the cloud reflectivity are 0.6 and 0.8, which correspond to optically thick (highly reflective) clouds. An optimal Lambertian cloud model will approximate the transmission and reflection of a real cloud [ ]. Snow cover poses a significant challenge for solar backscatter measurements of trace gases, as it can greatly change the radiative properties of the surface on short time scales (hours). The lack of contrast between snow and cloud in the UV‐Vis also makes it difficult to infer cloud cover. In this work, we use cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered observations from OMI to determine global surface reflectivity under both snow‐covered and snow‐free conditions. provides a brief description of the satellite instruments and data sets used in our analysis. describes our cloud and aerosol screening techniques and applies them to retrieve the global surface reflectivity. assesses the surface reflectivity over snow‐covered lands. investigates the implications of our snow‐covered surface reflectivity on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using NO 2 as an example. Instruments and Data The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is a Dutch/Finnish imaging spectrograph that measures the solar and Earth radiance spectrum from 270 to 500 nm [ ]. OMI has a ground pixel resolution of 13 km × 24 km at nadir and a 114° swath, which allows for daily global coverage. OMI is on board the NASA Aura satellite that launched in July 2004. Aura is part of the A‐Train constellation of satellites in polar orbits with equator crossing times near 1330 local time. NO 2 is retrieved from OMI measurements over 405–465 nm where NO 2 absorbs strongly, and there is little interference from other trace gases. Two OMI NO 2 products exist, the standard product [ ] and the DOMINO product [ ]. There are also two OMI cloud products [ ; ]. Both NO 2 retrievals use a cloud product based on absorption from the O 2 ‐O 2 collision complex (OMCLDO2) [ ; ]. The currently available Collection 3 products originally used surface LERs taken from the climatology of , based on 5.5 years of GOME measurements. Use of the LER climatology has been implemented as of orbit number 24349 (11 February 2009) in both NO 2 products and is planned for future versions of the NO 2 products. The OMI cloud and NO 2 retrievals use the near real‐time ice concentration and snow extent (NISE) data set ( , updated daily) to infer snow coverage. The NISE data set uses microwave measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument on board the DMSP F13 satellite. Because of its near‐polar, Sun‐synchronous orbit, the frequency of observations by the SSM/I is greater than 1/d above 55°. The principle of the snow detection algorithm is based on the scattering of microwave radiation, emitted from the underlying soil, by snow grains [ , ; ]. Wet snow emits microwave radiation similar to the underlying surface and so is not detected in this way. The NISE data set has not been validated but is known to consistently miss thin snow cover. A snow flag is provided in the OMI product, which indicates if a scene contains dry snow according to the NISE data set. For many scenes flagged as dry snow by the NISE data set, the current OMI cloud and NO 2 retrievals replace the climatological surface LER with a value of 0.6 to account for increased reflectivity due to snow. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an instrument currently on board two NASA satellites, Terra and Aqua. MODIS measures radiances in 36 spectral bands from 0.415 to 14.235 μ m at high spatial resolution [ ]. The nadir spatial resolution varies between bands from 250 to 1 km. Each MODIS instrument takes measurements over the entire globe every 1–2 days. Aqua was launched in May 2002 into a near‐polar, Sun‐synchronous orbit with a 1330 local overpass time. It was the first member of the A‐Train. In this study, we use three MODIS Collection 5 Level‐2 data products: the cloud mask [ ], the cloud optical depth [ ], and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) [ ]. The AOD product uses the first seven spectral bands (0.47–2.13 μ m), while the cloud products use additional bands at infrared wavelengths. Recent validation studies indicate that the MODIS cloud mask performs well except over polar regions at night [ ; ]. The MODIS cloud mask follows a separate set of tests when the possibility of snow is detected. These snow‐covered scenes are of particular interest to the current study. In their comparison with an arctic ground‐based lidar and radar, report that during the day MODIS/Terra misidentifies 2.7% of cloudy scenes as clear sky and 6.9% clear‐sky scenes as cloudy. Climatology of Cloud‐ and Aerosol‐Filtered Snow‐Free Surface LER Development of the Climatology The retrieval of surface reflectivity from OMI measurements requires accurate assessment of the fraction of TOA radiance that was reflected by atmospheric constituents versus the fraction from the surface. In particular, information is needed about clouds and aerosols, which are spatially inhomogeneous and significantly reflective. Because the OMI cloud and aerosol products depend on the a priori surface reflectivity, additional information is required to retrieve the surface reflectivity. In this study, the MODIS cloud and aerosol masks are used to determine the presence of clouds and aerosols within the OMI field of view. Using MODIS to screen the atmospheric constituents permits detection of clear‐sky OMI scenes without the use of statistical methods to eliminate cloud and aerosol contamination, even when surface LER is unknown. We regrid the MODIS cloud mask onto a 0.25° × 0.25° grid for each orbit. All grid cells containing measurements flagged as cloudy or uncertain in the MODIS cloud mask are designated as cloudy. We account for horizontal displacement of the clouds during the time between the MODIS and OMI overpass ( t MODIS‐OMI ∼ 15 min) by flagging all grid squares, to which a cloud could have propagated, as potentially cloudy. We use the maximum tropospheric wind vectors ( v max ) at the cloud location from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System GEOS 5 assimilated meteorological data. For each cloudy grid cell, all grid cells up to a distance v max × t MODIS‐OMI away in each direction are also flagged as contaminated. We similarly use the MODIS AOD product to screen for aerosol. All 0.25° grid points containing a pixel with an AOD greater than 0.2 are flagged as contaminated and allowed to propagate to a distance v max × t MODIS‐OMI . Lowering the tolerance for AOD to 0.05 yields no noticeable difference in the remaining results. We apply the cloud/aerosol mask to check each OMI pixel in the same orbit for possible contamination. OMI pixels that do not intersect a flagged cell are considered clear‐sky scenes. OMI pixels that extend beyond the MODIS swath are rejected. We use this database of cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered OMI scenes to create a climatology of surface reflectivity. For clear‐sky scenes, the retrieval of the surface LER becomes a simple inversion of , where I TOA ( R = 0) is equal to the Rayleigh scattering of the atmosphere. We use the scene LERs provided in the OMI Rotational Raman (OMCLDRR) cloud product [ ] at 354 nm (346–354 nm) as measurements of surface LER for cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered scenes. When the OMCLDRR cloud fraction is less than 5%, the LER model is used (as opposed to the mixed LER approach) and an effective scene pressure is retrieved. This is the case for the majority of our cloud‐free scenes; however, greater cloud fractions remain due to incorrect characterization of the surface reflectivity in the cloud retrieval. We eliminate scenes with retrieved pressures that differ by more than 100 hPa from the surface pressure to further exclude residual aerosols and clouds that prevent light from traveling through the full extent of the atmosphere (removes 23% of remaining measurements). We exclude data that are flagged as potentially affected by Sun glint (removes 24% of remaining measurements) and use the NISE data set to eliminate snow cover. Finally, we exclude outliers with scene LERs greater than 0.3 to eliminate residual snow cover and remaining occurrences of direct reflection. This last criterion removes 0.14% of the remaining measurements. shows the mean measured surface reflectivity using 3 years of data (2005, 2006, and 2007) at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. Ocean surface LERs are typically in the range of 0.05–0.10. The reflectivity of oceans is largely governed by suspended particles and phytoplankton since water itself absorbs weakly at UV wavelengths [ ; ]. Over land the surface LER is typically in the range of 0.01–0.10. Absorption by chlorophyll leads to vegetated regions being darker, whereas deserts are brighter (LERs up to 0.2). Shadowing in mountainous regions causes the LER to reach values near zero. White areas indicate where persistent cloud or aerosol lead to little or no data after filtering. Between 60°N and 60°S, 20% of the grid cells in contain less than 10 valid measurements. We estimate the precision on the values in by examining the variability of the measured LERs in each grid cell. Over land, the standard error of the mean is typically 0.005. This estimate includes contributions from the subpixel variation in surface LER and variation in the bidirectional reflectance function. Over oceans, where there are fewer measurements, the standard error increases to 0.01. Radiometric uncertainty additionally contributes to the total error. Comparison With Existing Climatologies We use our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered surface LER data set to evaluate three previous climatologies used in satellite retrievals of atmospheric constituents. derive surface LERs at 1° × 1.25° resolution based on minimum observed radiances in the 340–380 nm window from 14.5 years of TOMS data (henceforth referred to as TOMS MinLER). derive surface LERs at 1° × 1° resolution based on minimum observed radiances from GOME over a 5.5 year period (henceforth referred to as GOME MinLER). We interpolate between the GOME MinLER values at 335 and 380 nm to estimate the LERs at 354 nm before comparing to our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered reflectivities. produce two climatologies of surface reflectivity at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution from 3 years of OMI radiances. The first climatology is also based on minimum observed radiances (henceforth referred to as OMI MinLER). They argue, however, that the minimum surface LER may not be the most appropriate value since the minimum could occur due to darkening by precipitation or shading from cloud or ground. Also, the minimum is likely to select the lowest value in the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). For their second climatology (henceforth referred to as OMI LER), a histogram of measured scene LERs is created for each grid point around the globe. The surface LER is typically chosen as either the mode or the 1% cumulative probable value of the histogram. The OMI LER product allows for more than minimal seasonal snow cover. We ignore regions where this is permitted in our evaluation with our strictly snow‐free climatology. We calculate the surface LERs from our cloud‐free data set at the resolution of each of the four climatologies. We calculate monthly differences between our product and these previous climatologies and then average to produce seasonal and annual differences. summarizes the comparison. All four of the annual global mean climatologies are within 0.01 of our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. Our product is more consistent with the OMI LER product than the OMI MinLER product. This supports the selection of surface LERs using a histogram rather than choosing the minimum. However, when scenes with more than minimal seasonal snow cover are included, the OMI LER is less consistent with our data set (mean difference, 0.01; standard deviation, 0.07). The GOME MinLER climatology is higher on average by 0.01 than our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. A possible explanation is residual cloud in the GOME climatology that arises from the large pixel size and the relatively few measurements used in constructing the climatology. The 14.5 year data set used in the construction of the TOMS MinLER yields lower surface LERs than our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered product. Differences in radiometric calibration could contribute to interinstrument differences. The difference in local overpass times between OMI (1345), TOMS (∼1200), and GOME (1030) is unlikely to explain the observed discrepancies since the OMI‐TOMS difference is opposite in sign from the OMI‐GOME difference. shows the mean seasonal differences in surface LER between our product and three of the previous climatologies; OMI MinLER is omitted. Differences with the OMI LER climatology for remote oceans are typically within 0.01, while coastal OMI LER values tend to be lower by up to 0.03. Vegetated regions over land are generally higher in the OMI LER product by 0.01–0.02. In regions where higher dust loading is expected [ ], the OMI LER is generally lower by 0.01–0.03. Suspended dust lowers the apparent reflectivity [ ; ] and could contribute to the difference. Although we screen for aerosols using MODIS AOD and by neglecting measurements with high scene pressures, persistent thin aerosol layers could still affect our product. This implies the difference between OMI LER and the true LER could be even larger. The GOME and TOMS MinLER climatologies are distinctly lower in areas of enhanced dust aerosol. In particular, TOMS MinLER is lower by more then 0.1 over the deserts of Saudi Arabia between March and August. GOME MinLER is higher for oceans by up to 0.04. Seasonal snow cover could contribute to the discrepancies at northern high latitudes where GOME MinLER is up to 0.1 higher. Climatology of Snow‐Covered Surface LER Here we develop a climatology of snow‐covered surface LER and examine its dependence on season and vegetation before comparing with previous climatologies. Data Set Development We first evaluate the usefulness of using the NISE data set to determine if an OMI scene is snow covered by comparing the snow flag to collocated ground‐based measurements of snow depth. Snow‐on‐ground data are from the Canadian Daily Climate Data collected by Environment Canada ( ) at the Calgary and Edmonton airports. These cities were chosen for the homogeneity of the surrounding land (no nearby large bodies of water) and occurrence of both snow‐covered and snow‐free scenes. The ground‐based measurements are determined to be collocated with the OMI measurement if the OMI pixel center is within 0.5° (∼50 km) of the airport. We divide snow depths into three categories: snow free, thin snow (up to 5 cm), and thick snow (more than 5 cm.) Data from the months of November, December, January, February, and March of 2005 and 2006 (10 months in total) are used in this comparison. This corresponds to a total of 8173 OMI pixels, 53% flagged as dry snow and 47% flagged as snow free. Snow cover data for April were unavailable for most airports. shows the fraction of ground‐based observations which fall into each of the three snow depth categories as a function of the NISE snow flag. Only 6% of the measurements with the NISE dry snow classification showed no snow on ground for that day at the nearby airport. However, for measurements with the snow‐free classification, 69% had at least some snow on ground for that day at the nearby airport and 20% had snow depths of more than 5 cm. We conclude that the NISE dry snow classification is a good indication that a scene contains snow but that the snow‐free classification is unreliable in regions that could contain seasonal snow cover. Spatial sampling bias is an unlikely explanation. Increasing the collocation criteria to 0.1° (∼10 km) decreases to 5% (215 observations) the fraction of dry snow scenes with no snow on ground but increases to 74% (207 observations) the fraction of snow‐free scenes with at least some snow on ground. We develop a data set of snow‐covered surface reflectivity by using the mean surface LER viewed by OMI for scenes that are cloud free, as determined with the MODIS cloud mask, and snow covered, as flagged in the OMI product according to the NISE data set. (top) shows the mean observed LER of seasonal snow covered lands at 354 nm. The resulting LER depends strongly on the local vegetation type. The transition from the northern Canadian boreal forest (LER ∼ 0.4) through the taiga to the arctic tundra (LER ∼ 0.9) demonstrates the role of tall vegetation in masking the highly reflective snow [ ]. The prairies of central North America and Asia are highly reflective (LER ∼ 0.8). Mountainous regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau, exhibit non‐Lambertian behavior and have low LERs (∼0.1) even when snow is present. Low LER values in the southeastern United States may arise from transient snow and a temporal mismatch of a few days between the SSM/I and OMI observations. Strict cloud screening leads to the rejection of nearly all OMI data over many locations in winter months. To increase the spatial extent of our data set, we relax the cloud screening algorithm. Our cloud‐filtered data set is extended by only designating grid cells as contaminated if they contain clouds with optical depths greater than one. We account for the horizontal displacement of these optically thick clouds as before. (bottom) shows the mean surface LERs calculated using this relaxed cloud screening criteria. The LERs from this expanded data set are similar to those from the strictly cloudless data though the spatial coverage is improved. Forested regions have mean LERs as low as 0.3 even in the presence of snow. We examined the effect of relaxing the cloud screening criteria by comparing the newly accepted LER measurements to those that are part of the strictly cloud‐free data set. The two data sets typically agree to within 0.05. Exceptions are over the bright prairies where clouds reduce the LER by approximately 0.1 and over the Tibetan Plateau where clouds increase the surface LER by approximately 0.15. We examine the temporal variability in the snow‐covered LER to estimate the potential of using the expanded data set as a reliable measure of the snow‐covered surface reflectivity. Standard deviations of the LERs throughout Canada and Russia are typically less than 0.15. These low standard deviations indicate that the surface reflectivity of snow‐covered surfaces is represented within 10%–20%. Higher standard deviations of up to 0.3 to the south indicate that snow‐covered surface reflectivity is difficult to predict in regions with thin or transient snow. Sensitivity to Vegetation Here we examine the dependence of our expanded snow‐covered surface LER data set on the underlying vegetation type. We use the MODIS land cover product (MOD12C1) to determine the percentage of each International Geosphere‐Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover type in each grid cell. We mask mountainous regions due to their non‐Lambertian behavior. We then estimate the reflectivity of the various snow‐covered land types in two different ways. The first method uses only pixels containing at least 95% of a single vegetation type. The second uses the maximum land cover type of each grid cell. This corresponds to the land cover type that occupies the largest fraction of the grid cell. shows the LER of the snow‐covered land types calculated in these two different ways. The differences between the mean LERs using the two methods reflect both the low sampling over some land cover types and the complex interaction of the vegetation types in determining the overall optical properties of the surface. The large variation with vegetation type has been well documented [ ; ; ]. This is due to the tops of the vegetation that extend beyond the snow‐covered surface, thus partially obscuring the highly reflective snow from the satellite instrument [ ]. also includes vegetation dependence from previous work. provide snow‐covered LER estimates for locations containing at least 95% of a single vegetation type. Our results are similar except for cropland, which corresponds to largely different regions in their land cover type database when compared to the MODIS land cover product. provide snow‐covered albedo estimates for various maximum land types. Their results are consistent with ours with the exception of the albedo over deciduous broadleaf forests. This land cover type is the least sampled in our data set and may not be well represented. Seasonal Variation The reflectivity of snow‐covered lands further depends on several factors that change with time. We assess the seasonal variation of the snow‐covered surface LERs using the monthly mean from grid cells that contain data for all 6 months, November through April. shows the observed mean seasonal variation in LER of snow‐covered surfaces in the Northern Hemisphere. Reflectivity increases until January and then decreases through to April. The reflectivity of snow increases with solar zenith angle [ ]; however, argue that snow depth is the most crucial parameter in determining variation in the surface reflectivity. Deposition of soot and increase in grain size also lower the reflectivity of snow as it ages [ ]. During the melting season, the LER drops by 0.1, likely due to decreases in snow depth. Temporal mismatch between OMI and SSM/I may further contribute to the decrease in reflectivity. Comparison With Existing Climatologies shows the difference between our snow‐covered surface reflectivity database versus the three previous climatologies in winter months. GOME and TOMS MinLER are, by design, measures of the surface LER under conditions of minimal snow cover. This leads to both climatologies being lower than our snow‐covered surface reflectivities. The OMI LER product allows for more than minimal snow cover in their surface reflectivities leading to LERs that are more consistent with our snow‐covered surface LERs. However, regions such as the plains of south central Canada remain with large differences because of irregular but highly reflective snow cover. Locations where our snow‐covered surface LER data set is lower than the OMI LER product, such as the Pacific coast of Canada and Eastern Europe, could indicate cloud contamination in the OMI LER product in winter months, since the surface reflectivity is expected to be at a maximum when snow is present. The large differences between our snow‐covered product and all three previous climatologies demonstrate the difficulty in using a single value for the surface LER, in regions where seasonal snow cover is potentially present. It is therefore desirable to have two separate LERs in retrievals of atmospheric constituents: one for the snow‐free case and one for the snow‐covered case. UV‐Vis Trace Gas Retrievals Over Snow Trace gas retrievals using solar backscatter over regions of seasonal snow often are considered unreliable due to the difficulty in detecting snow, the uncertainty in its reflectivity, and the difficulty in detecting clouds in the presence of snow. Should these difficulties be overcome, a snow‐covered scene provides a better trace gas measurement than a snow‐free scene. We explore the effect of snow on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using tropospheric NO 2 as an example. Our snow‐covered surface LER database is measured at 354 nm, whereas the OMI NO 2 retrieval is centered on 435 nm. However, the wavelength difference is of little consequence for our analysis due to the weak spectral dependence of snow in the UV‐Vis. report that the albedo of a thin snow layer (2 cm) on grass rises from 0.656 at 350 nm to 0.678 at 440 nm. In the data set compiled by , we find a mean difference of 0.006 between the surface reflectivities at 354 and 440 nm in regions where snow is observed. shows the effect of surface reflectivity on the random error in the AMF for tropospheric NO 2 . Tropospheric AMFs are calculated for each surface reflectivity using a modeled NO 2 profile over the city of Edmonton, Canada. The tropospheric column errors are then generated using the formulation of . Error in the tropospheric AMF is often the dominant term in polluted regions. indicates that for cloud‐free scenes over cities the random error in the tropospheric AMF decreases from 25% over a nonreflective surface to 3% over a surface with a reflectivity of 0.4. This improvement is due to the increased sensitivity to the lower atmosphere, where the majority of the NO 2 column is located. shows the OMI tropospheric NO 2 column (including NO 2 below cloud) from the standard product [ ] over the cities of Calgary and Edmonton for the three different snow‐on‐ground categories described in . OMI NO 2 columns over thick snow are 60% larger than those over snow‐free surfaces. NO 2 columns in conditions reported as completely cloudy are a factor of four larger than those for cloud‐free conditions. We compare to hourly in situ measurements taken at various locations in the two cities as part of the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. In contrast, these ground‐based measurements exhibit only 13% higher NO 2 concentrations over thick snow compared to snow free and have no trend ( r = 0.15) with reported cloud fraction. The bias arises from both false cloud detection and underestimates in surface reflectivity as discussed below. Errors in the a priori surface reflectivity will introduce errors in the OMI cloud fraction retrieval, so we make the distinction between the cloud fractions reported in the OMI product and real cloud fractions. The surface LER affects the AMF calculation both directly and through the cloud retrieval. Both of these aspects need to be considered when correcting the NO 2 retrieval over snow for errors in the a priori surface LER. We address the direct effect by using our climatology of snow‐covered surface LERs and the cloud effect by only using scenes from our expanded cloud‐free data set. For each of these cloud‐free scenes, two AMFs are calculated at 440 nm. The first is calculated with the original surface LER and reported cloud fraction. The second (corrected) AMF is calculated using our snow‐covered surface LER and a cloud fraction of zero. Relative differences in these two AMFs are used to infer relative biases in the tropospheric NO 2 column for scenes flagged as snow covered. Both OMI NO 2 retrievals (standard and DOMINO) currently use the same cloud and surface LER data so our results are applicable to both products. (top) shows the mean relative bias in the OMI NO 2 retrieval over snow. Retrievals over highly reflective snow‐covered grasslands overestimate the tropospheric NO 2 column by more than 100%. These regions exhibit large underestimates of the surface reflectivity for snow‐covered scenes ( ), which leads to underestimates in the sensitivity to NO 2 in the lower atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to overestimates in the total NO 2 column. Elsewhere, blue regions in (top) reveal underestimates in the NO 2 columns over snow that arise from overestimates in the surface LER. Snow‐related bias in the NO 2 retrieval is smaller in the northernmost regions where snow cover is better represented. Though only cloud‐free scenes (as inferred from MODIS) are used in this analysis, nonzero cloud fractions are commonly reported in the OMICLDO2 product due to errors in the a priori surface LER. In snow‐covered regions, the lack of contrast between cloud and surface exacerbates this problem. We find that any cloud fraction can be reported in OMICLDO2, even for MODIS‐determined cloud‐free scenes. In a typical study of mean NO 2 columns, scenes with cloud fractions greater than a certain threshold (for example, 0.3 or 0.5) are rejected to ensure sensitivity to the surface in all measurements. (bottom) shows the mean bias in the OMI tropospheric NO 2 retrieval for (MODIS determined) cloud‐free scenes when an OMI cloud fraction threshold of 0.3 is applied. The overestimates evident in (top) are reduced to less than 20%. This is because an underestimate of the surface reflectivity yields an overestimate in the cloud fraction, which increases the likelihood that the scene will be rejected as cloudy. The low biased regions in (top) are, however, largely unaltered because an overestimate in surface reflectivity will ensure a cloud fraction of zero is reported. Though this study is confined to cloud‐free scenes, the trend of underestimating NO 2 in regions where the surface reflectivity is overestimated and rejecting scenes where the surface reflectivity is underestimated will persist for most partially cloudy scenes. This implies that mean NO 2 columns tend to be underestimated over snow‐covered surfaces where the surface LER is poorly characterized. Future cloud and trace gas retrievals would benefit from a separate surface LER database for snow‐covered scenes. The general effects found here for NO 2 should be similar for other trace gas retrievals in the UV‐Vis. Conclusion We have created a database of surface reflectivity at 354 nm using observations from two satellite instruments in the A‐Train. MODIS/Aqua observations were used to identify and exclude scenes contaminated by cloud and aerosol. OMI observations of the resultant clear‐sky scenes were used to determine the Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) of both snow‐free and snow‐covered lands. We applied this database to evaluate previous surface LER climatologies from TOMS, GOME, and OMI. Our snow‐free cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered surface LERs, where available, agree well (mean difference, 0.0002; standard deviation, 0.011) with the OMI LER [ ] climatology. Differences of up to 0.05 remain over regions with a large dust influence. Other climatologies which select the minimum observed LER as the surface LER, exhibit greater discrepancies (mean difference >0.002; standard deviation >0.02) versus our cloud‐ and aerosol‐filtered data set. Our analysis focused on LER, as currently used in OMI retrievals. In reality, the surface reflectivity has angular dependence. An improved description of the surface reflectivity, which better characterizes the bidirectional reflectance function, should improve future retrievals using solar backscatter. We evaluated surface LER characteristics for snow‐covered lands at 354 nm. Our snow‐covered surface reflectivity database depends strongly on the underlying vegetation. Surface LERs range from 0.3 for some forested regions to 0.8 over shrubland. The mean LER of snow‐covered lands in the Northern Hemisphere increases by 0.1 from November to January and decreases by 0.1 through March. None of the previous climatologies used in trace gas retrievals agree well with our mean snow‐covered surface LERs in winter months. This is largely by design as TOMS MinLER and GOME MinLER report the surface LERs for minimum snow cover. OMI LER allows for a contribution to the surface LER by snow, but this leads to some cloud contamination in winter months. Furthermore, including seasonal snow in the climatological surface LER leads to ambiguity in surface LER and therefore in trace gas retrievals over snow. We propose the use of a separate surface LER database for snow‐covered scenes. We investigated the effect of seasonal snow cover on UV‐Vis trace gas retrievals using NO 2 as an example. The weak spectral dependence of snow in the UV‐Vis allows application of our data set at 354 nm for OMI NO 2 retrievals at 440 nm. OMI NO 2 retrievals over central Canada exhibit dependence on cloud and snow that is inconsistent with in situ measurements. Underestimates in the snow‐covered surface reflectivity lead to overestimates in the OMI NO 2 and cloud fraction retrievals, even when no clouds are present in the field of view of the instrument. These scenes tend to get rejected by cloud fraction filters due to the overestimated cloud fractions. Conversely, overestimates of the surface reflectivity lead to underestimates in both the OMI NO 2 and cloud fraction retrievals. These scenes are then preferentially accepted by cloud fraction filters because of the artificially low cloud fractions. The net effect is that NO 2 columns tend to be underestimated over seasonal snow‐covered lands if a cloud fraction filter is applied. Random errors in the surface reflectivity will also lead to systematic underestimates in the NO 2 column when a cloud fraction filter is used. This is because scenes where the surface reflectivity is underestimated tend to underestimate NO 2 and are preferentially selected by the cloud fraction filter. If well characterized, snow increases the sensitivity of UV‐Vis retrievals to trace gases in the lower troposphere. However, snow detection is challenging, and we find that the NISE snow‐free classification is less reliable for OMI scenes in regions containing thin snow cover. OMI products could benefit from the use of a validated data set such as the MODIS snow cover product [ ]. Emerging snow/ice/cloud data from SCIAMACHY [ ; ] may be useful for future work. We did not explore the effects of scenes that are incorrectly flagged (either as snow covered or snow free) on the retrieved mean NO 2 columns. In addition, partially cloudy scenes could be affected to a different degree than the clear‐sky scenes used in our comparisons. For these reasons, our results should only be used as guidelines for assessing the effect of snow on the OMI NO 2 retrieval and not as a quantitative measure of the overall bias due to snow. Future satellite missions to measure trace gases using solar backscatter would benefit from additional discrete spectral bands at longer wavelengths to improve discrimination between cloud and snow.

Strong upward motions associated with storms rapidly transport gases emitted at the surface to the midtroposphere and upper troposphere where atmospheric residence times are typically increased. Stronger winds at high altitudes may also facilitate transport over greater distances from source regions than if species had remained near the surface [e.g., ; ; ]. Some extreme convective events can cause mixing across the tropopause [e.g., ], altering the concentrations of radiatively active trace gases in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. A recent modeling study by suggests that convection penetrating the stratosphere can strongly influence upper tropospheric ozone mixing ratios over the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude continents in summer. GCMs are typically run at resolutions too low to resolve individual convective events meaning that convective processes must be parameterized; this remains one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in weather and climate simulations [ ]. Much uncertainty surrounds the role of convection in relation to other transport processes such as turbulence or advection by the large‐scale atmospheric circulation. Contributing to this uncertainty is the fact that the representation of convection varies widely among models. For example, showed that the use of different convective schemes in a single GCM could strongly impact the distribution of precipitation as well as the atmospheric energy budget. used three different sets of meteorological fields to drive offline chemical transport model (CTM) simulations of radionuclide transport. Their results showed that the role played by convective transport varied substantially among the different meteorological fields. Several studies of the effect of convection on tropospheric ozone underscore the uncertainties associated with the process. estimated that convection increases the tropospheric ozone burden by 12% due to the transport of ozone precursors from the boundary layer to the middle and upper troposphere where they are longer lived and more efficient at producing ozone. In contrast, found that convection decreases the tropospheric ozone burden by 13% due to the upward transport of lower ozone air near the surface to altitudes where the lifetime of ozone is extended and the downward mixing of higher ozone air to lower altitudes where it is more rapidly destroyed. suggest that much of the difference between the results of the two studies may stem from the large differences in the height and intensity of deep convection. discuss the difficulties faced by these types of sensitivity studies, because transport by convection is treated by the convective parameterization while a component of the large‐scale flow occurs in convective updrafts such as those found in the Walker and Hadley cells. In particular, within the deep convective parameterization, updraft mass fluxes are balanced by subsidence within the same column while in reality these motions form part of the large‐scale circulation, a point also discussed by . As a consequence, the role of convective transport in determining trace gas distributions cannot be properly determined by simply shutting off transport by convective mass flux as in the and studies because the component of the convection associated with the large‐scale flow is untreated. While substantial differences exist between different convective schemes and their implementation in various GCMs, significant uncertainty can be introduced into simulated trace gas distributions by the assumptions made within a single scheme. showed how varying parameter settings in the Relaxed Arakawa‐Schubert (RAS) convection module impacts tropical precipitation patterns in the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS‐5) GCM. compared simulations of several thunderstorms observed during different field projects by cloud‐resolving models (CRMs) and by a single‐column model (SCM) version of the GEOS‐5 GCM. In addition to comparisons with cloud‐resolving model results, the study examined the issue of parameter sensitivity within the GEOS‐5 moist physics code. The results showed that the strong impacts of the parameter settings on convective mass fluxes affect vertical trace gas distributions in the single‐column model. In this work, we seek to better understand the role of convective transport in determining atmospheric CO distributions, emphasizing the uncertainty introduced into simulations of atmospheric composition through different tunings (parameter settings) in a single convective scheme. This is done by analyzing an ensemble of simulations constructed using alterations to parameter settings in the model's moist physics schemes. of this paper describes the model used and details the parameter sensitivity experiments. In , we examine the impact of parameter sensitivity on simulated CO distributions. presents a summary and conclusions to be drawn from this work. Model Experiments Description of the GEOS‐5 AGCM The GEOS‐5 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) has been developed as a flexible tool to represent the atmosphere on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. It is a central component of the GEOS‐5 atmospheric data assimilation system [ ], where it is used with half‐degree spatial resolution for meteorological analysis and forecasting [ ]. It has also been developed as a tool for studying atmospheric composition and climate. The AGCM combines the finite volume dynamical core described by with the GEOS‐5 column physics package, summarized by . The model domain extends from the surface to 0.01 hPa and uses 72 hybrid layers that transition from terrain‐following near the surface to pure pressure levels above 180 hPa. In this study, the horizontal resolution is 1° × 1.25° (latitude by longitude) and the time step is 30 min for physical computations, with more frequent computations of resolved‐scale transport in the dynamical core. The eight‐member ensemble of simulations presented in this work consists of 4 year simulations from 2000 to 2003. Moist processes in GEOS‐5 are represented by a convective parameterization and prognostic cloud scheme. Convection is parameterized using the Relaxed Arakawa‐Schubert (RAS) scheme of , a modified version of the Arakawa‐Schubert scheme [ ], in which the atmosphere is relaxed toward quasi‐equilibrium, reducing the convective available potential energy (CAPE) as it is produced by large‐scale processes. RAS represents convection as a sequence of linearly entraining plumes sharing the same base level but characterized by unique detrainment levels. All levels between the cloud base and 100 hPa are tested for the possibility of convection by calculating the cloud base mass flux for each plume using a CAPE‐based closure. This mass flux is used to modify environmental temperature and moisture profiles; subsequent plumes receive the modified sounding. Consequently, the convective mass flux considered here represents the collective effect of updrafts produced by the ensemble of plumes. The effect of each convective updraft plume on tracers consists of two parts. In‐plume upward transport directly changes the grid box tracer value through cloud top detrainment [ ]. This process can lead for example to the sudden appearance of boundary layer tracers near the tropopause during a single time step. Next, compensating subsidence in the plume‐free environment induces further changes through downward advection of tracer. This subsidence is a design feature of mass‐flux convection parameterizations and should not be confused with explicit downdrafts. Convective downdrafts are not included in this version of the model but are in development for future versions. RAS calculates profiles of convective condensate within supersaturated plumes by reducing humidity by the amount necessary to achieve saturation. The prognostic cloud scheme contained in GEOS‐5 calculates large‐scale ice and liquid condensate by assuming a probability distribution function (pdf) of total water. Condensate is removed from the domain by evaporation, autoconversion of liquid condensate, sedimentation of frozen condensate, and accretion of condensate by falling precipitation. The version of GEOS‐5 used in this work includes transport, emission, and chemical loss of CO. Biomass burning emissions of CO follow the GFED‐2 inventory described by which is based on TRMM and MODIS observations of hot spots and burned area; emissions are prescribed monthly and reflect the interannual variability of fire activity. Fossil fuel emissions follow while biofuel emissions of CO are described by . Biofuel and fossil fuel emissions over Asia are increased by 46% to account for recent increases in emissions [ ]; this includes a 39% increase in direct emission of CO and an additional 7% increase to represent CO produced by hydrocarbon photochemistry not represented in the simplified chemistry scheme. These changes were based on the work of who analyzed forward and inverse modeling studies of CO emission and transport over Asia during several field campaigns. In addition to direct emissions, CO is produced photochemically from methane and nonmethane hydrocarbons as described by . While CO emissions from biomass burning vary interannually, monthly emissions from fossil fuels, biofuels, and hydrocarbon oxidation do not. Loss of CO occurs through reaction with OH using a prescribed loss frequency. Monthly mean OH fields are taken from a simulation of the year 2001 by the GMI model [ ] and are not affected by reaction with CO. Recent work by suggests that the interannual variability of OH is small when annual means are considered; they estimate interannual variability in global tropospheric OH of 0.9 ± 0.8% based on model simulations. Though interannual variability of OH may be small, differences in OH over smaller time scales may be considerably larger because OH is affected by emissions; for example, showed that OH abundance over Indonesia was significantly altered by CO emissions from the massive 1997 fire outbreak. This simplified treatment of chemistry [ ] allows focus on transport effects, but does limit the potential for such feedbacks between convective transport and CO chemistry on the OH distribution. Trace gases are transported online in GEOS‐5 using the dynamical core for resolved scales; turbulent mixing of CO is performed in the same way as for moisture (using the boundary layer turbulence module); and using RAS for convective transport. Convective transport is calculated by allowing each plume in RAS to successively modify the vertical trace gas profiles, in the same way that environmental temperature and moisture profiles are modified, to represent the collective effects of an ensemble of clouds of differing heights which could coexist within a model grid cell. The Control Simulation Global simulations were carried out using the GEOS‐5 AGCM in “free‐running” mode. In this mode, the model reads prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice distributions, which are obtained from observations [ ]. Atmospheric observations are not assimilated. Such simulations generally produce direct SST‐forced variations that agree, in monthly and seasonal means, with the climate for the years of the input SSTs (in this case, 2000–2003), but do not reproduce specific weather features such as fronts or storm systems. Such simulations also do not generally represent extratropical circulations, such as stationary wave patterns, that are well aligned with those of any particular year in the real atmosphere. As a result, we focus on monthly and seasonal average results. A control simulation was conducted in which the GEOS‐5 AGCM was configured with default parameter settings of the GEOS‐5.1.0 version [ ]. Relevant information about this will be discussed in the context of the ensemble of perturbation experiments. Atmospheric carbon monoxide, with imposed emissions and simple atmospheric loss computations, was included in the AGCM. To set the context for this work, a brief overview of the simulated CO is presented. shows a comparison of simulated column CO data from GEOS‐5 with observations obtained from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) [ ] instrument aboard the EOS Terra satellite. The MOPITT product used is monthly mean version 4 level 2 data [ ] gridded at 1° horizontal resolution. MOPITT has the greatest sensitivity to CO located in the midtroposphere, with little sensitivity to near‐surface CO [ ]. Prior versions of MOPITT data contained significant high biases in column CO when compared with estimates based on in situ observations as documented by . The version 4 products presented here contain significantly less bias. Compared to in situ profiles, estimated biases less than 1% at the surface, 700 hPa, and 100 hPa with a larger bias of −6% at 400 hPa. Additionally, MOPITT data are subject to a bias drift of 2 ppbv per year at 400 hPa and 1 ppb per year at 700 hPa. The column bias drift was 2 × 10 16 molecules cm −2 per year with an estimated uncertainty of 5 × 10 15 molecules cm −2 [ ]. In order to ensure that the GEOS‐5 column CO is comparable to MOPITT, GEOS‐5 column CO is calculated by regridding model output to the 1° horizontal resolution of the MOPITT product and applying the MOPITT averaging kernels as described by . In April, the peak biomass burning season in southeast Asia, GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate column CO relative to MOPITT. The degree of underestimation is greatest in the Northern Hemisphere; GEOS‐5 simulations underestimate MOPITT observations by as much as 20% in some areas, although underestimates less than 10% are more common. In the Southern Hemisphere, GEOS‐5 generally compares well with MOPITT, although column CO is overestimated over equatorial South America by 10–20%. GEOS‐5 is able to capture the major feature in the CO distribution during April which is a strong peak in burning over southeast Asia that is transported over long distances across the Pacific by easterly winds. However, the model produces less CO over both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans which may indicate either weaker long‐range pollution transport than observed or errors in CO lifetime due to uncertainty in the prescribed OH fields. In October, a time of increased biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere, GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate CO in the Southern Hemisphere. Observed and simulated distributions of CO are dominated by biomass burning activity evident over South America and Indonesia and the transport of biomass burning CO over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The model tends to underestimate column CO over portions of sub‐Saharan Africa by 10–30% while in the south Pacific and Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes and high latitudes, underestimations are typically 10–20%. GEOS‐5 tends to overestimate the CO peak due to biomass burning in South America and Indonesia by as much as 50% in some areas. Globally, GEOS‐5 underestimates column CO as measured by MOPITT by 3.8% in April while differences in October are 4.4%. The similarity of GEOS‐5 results with MOPITT observations demonstrates that GEOS‐5 is able to produce reasonable CO distributions. Differences between simulated and observed CO mixing ratios are likely related to uncertainties in CO emissions and global OH distributions as well as differences in simulated and observed atmospheric transport. Ensemble Formulation The basis of this study is an eight‐member ensemble of simulations that was produced using a range of settings for various parameters that control deep convection in GEOS‐5. These parameter settings are based on the work of , who evaluated profiles of convective mass flux and trace gases produced by CRMs and a column version of GEOS‐5. identified the parameters in the moist physics part of GEOS‐5 whose values exert the greatest control over convective mass flux. Using a simple set of perturbations in the SCM, identified 16 parameters in the moist physics as exerting a 1% or greater change in the time averaged vertically integrated convective mass flux. These 16 parameters were included in the more rigorous and computationally intensive screening known as regional sensitivity analysis (RSA), introduced by and extended to include multiple criteria by . The technique allows identification of “sensitive” parameters, whose settings can significantly impact the evolution of the simulations. conducted a large number of “Monte Carlo” type SCM simulations of three storms assuming different parameter values and used the time‐averaged vertically integrated convective mass flux derived from CRM simulations as a criterion to identify parameter sets which produced the most favorable results. In this manner, identified five of the 16 parameters as strongly influencing convective mass flux. The five parameters identified as sensitive were RASAL1 and RASAL2 (used to determine the strength and vertical profile of the relaxation time scale for deep convection), ACRITFAC (a factor used to compute the critical value of the cloud work function which determines the initiation of convection), BASE_EVAP_FAC (used to determine the amount of rain evaporated into the environment below the cloud base), and AUTOC_CN (used in the calculation of the autoconversion of convective condensate). These five parameters were varied to construct the eight‐member ensemble of GEOS‐5 AGCM simulations used in this work ( ). The ensemble consists of one simulation assuming default parameter settings (shown in ); five simulations using these parameter settings, except with alterations to a single parameter; and two simulations in which all five of the sensitive parameters are varied to create the strongest (MaxConv) or weakest (MinConv) representations of convection considered reasonable. In addition to ensuring that a wide range of uncertainty is represented, the strong and weak convection allow added insight into how the simulated atmosphere responds when the magnitude of convective mass flux is substantially altered. An important component of these simulations is that all ensemble members produce representations of convection that are reasonable, within the bounds of our knowledge. To ensure that the modified parameter settings produce reasonable precipitation patterns, we used gridded data sets from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) that were compiled from satellite and rain gauge observations and compared with precipitation estimates produced by the eight ensemble members. After interpolating monthly mean precipitation rates from the ensemble to the 2.5° GPCP grid, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for all ensemble members and are shown in . The annual mean correlation coefficients between the various simulations and the GPCP data ranged from the highest values of 0.65, in both the control and MaxConv simulations, to as low as 0.58 in the MinConv simulation. computed correlation coefficients between the GPCP data set and nine simulations that used different convective schemes in a single GCM. In their study, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.57 to 0.72 depending on the convective scheme employed. As in the simulations presented here, the simulations used observed SSTs (without assimilating meteorological information). Because the range of correlation coefficients for the simulations presented are similar to those computed by , the ensemble at the center of this work is likely comparable in variability and realism to other studies of convective parameterization uncertainty. Results Ensemble Variability Because the simulations presented here are free‐running, small changes such as parameter setting can lead to different realizations of the atmosphere including divergent locations of fronts and weather systems; to minimize such affects and differentiate the impacts of the parameters from internal model variability, we primarily present comparisons of multiannual monthly or seasonal averages in which monthly output from each ensemble member is averaged over several years before calculating ensemble statistics such as means and spreads. shows the ensemble mean and spread of column CO in MAM and SON based on 2 year (2000–2001) seasonal averages. Perturbations to parameters in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes exert the greatest influence on column CO abundance near CO source regions and in nearby outflow pathways. In MAM, the largest impacts of changes to the model's representation of convection are found in southeast Asia over the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. During SON, ensemble spread is largest over Indonesia, where strong burning occurs, especially during El Nino years. Elevated variability is also found over South America to the south and west of the region of peak column CO associated with biomass burning. In regions farther removed from CO sources, changes to moist physics parameters typically play a relatively small role in determining CO distributions. Ensemble spreads between 3 and 6% can be found in outflow pathways transporting Asian and African biomass burning pollution in April. During October, areas where ensemble spread is greater than 3% extend over portions of the Southern Hemisphere oceans demonstrating that the model's representation of convection can alter transport of CO to midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. In order to compare how variability introduced by changes in the model representation of convection differs from other types of variability, a second ensemble of eight simulations was created by initializing simulations with meteorological fields representing different days in January 2000 following . These model runs were integrated for 2 years and multiannual seasonal averages computed. The fundamental difference between the two ensembles is that in the meteorological ensemble, different realizations are produced by altering only the beginning state of the integration while physical processes are treated identically in all simulations; in the convective ensemble, all members start from identical initial conditions, but important aspects of the moist physics code have been altered. A comparison of the means and spreads of the two ensembles can be used to assess seasonal variability due to the changes in the moist physics and seasonal variability due to solely internal model variability; it should be noted that because changes in model physics parameters trigger different realizations of simulated meteorology, it is not possible to entirely separate the two influences. Ensemble spreads for MAM and SON are shown in . In order to separate differences between the convective and meteorological ensembles caused by alterations to convective parameters from internal model variability, we use the Fisher test ( F test) for statistically significant difference in variance. Globally, the ensemble produced by altering convection produces slightly larger variability than does the ensemble representing internal model variability though in both cases, ensemble spreads are small. In source and outflow regions, these differences are greater. Areas in which the influence of convective parameters differs from internal model variability tend to occur in regions where strong convection coincides with CO sources (i.e., biomass burning regions in Africa, South America, and Indonesia). Over midlatitude source regions such as China or the east coast of the United States, convective ensemble spreads are small and similar to background values found in remote regions. In different layers of the atmosphere, the patterns of variability introduced into CO mixing ratios by changes in convective parameters can vary substantially. At the surface in MAM ( ), ensemble spreads exceed 20% throughout the Bay of Bengal indicating that alterations to the model representation of convection can influence the transport of southeast Asian biomass burning pollution. Transport by low‐level westerlies near the equator is also affected. In the midtroposphere and upper troposphere during April, the greatest variability in CO mixing ratios lies in southeast Asia and the trans‐Pacific transport pathways of CO. The transport of CO to Northern Hemisphere high‐latitude locations near the tropopause is strongly influenced by convection parameters. CO concentrations in the polar lower stratosphere also appear to be strongly influenced by changes in the representation of convection although mixing ratios in this region are likely to be sensitive to a number of factors (including tropopause pressure and the timing and characteristics of stratospheric vortex breakdown) which may differ between ensemble members. The convective ensemble contains a larger degree of variability than the meteorological ensemble in stratospheric air masses (latitudes north of the tropopause line in ). In SON ( ), differences among ensemble members are generally smaller than in MAM. The largest variability in CO mixing ratios at the surface is not found near the peak in biomass burning activity in South America. Instead, a large degree of variability is found near Indonesia. At 300 and 500 hPa, stronger variability is found over areas of South America and the Pacific Ocean near strong biomass burning activity. We also examine the impact of changes in moist physics parameters on CO mixing ratios at a number of remote surface sites maintained by NOAA's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG) observational network ( ). Data are collected weekly and are presented here for a subset of stations. GEOS‐5 model output is sampled on the same dates that observations were taken and is then interpolated to station locations and averaged monthly to produce an equivalent quantity. Using these monthly means, ensemble spreads are calculated at each station. It should be noted that the convective ensemble spread contains both the influence of changes in the model's moist physics and internal model variability. Simulated surface CO is assumed to be the mixing ratio in the lowest model layer. Simulations begin in January, 2000, but ensemble means and spreads are not calculated until March to allow time for differences in convection to alter CO distributions. GEOS‐5 is able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of CO at the GMD stations reasonably well ( ). At Northern Hemisphere midlatitude and high‐latitude stations represented here by Alert, Canada (ALT), Storhofdi, Iceland (ICE), and Shemya, Alaska (SHM), GEOS‐5 tends to underestimate CO relative to the surface observations in spring, which is consistent with the comparison with MOPITT observations shown in . At tropical and subtropical locations such as Assekrem, Algeria (ASK), Mariana Islands, Guam (GMI), Mahe Island, Seychelles (SEY) and Ascension Island (ASC, located between Africa and South America), GEOS‐5 is able to reasonably reproduce observed CO mixing ratios throughout the year though in some locations, peak CO mixing ratios associated with seasonal biomass burning are underestimated. Perturbations to parameters in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes tend to have a small impact at the remote surface sites sampled. Of all the GMD surface sites monitoring CO, changes to moist physics parameters most strongly affect the Tae‐ahn Peninsula (TAP) station located in Korea and strongly influenced by Asian biomass burning and anthropogenic CO. From 2000 to 2003, the average ensemble spread in monthly CO was 7% of the mean value with peak spreads exceeding 25%. CO mixing ratios are also strongly affected by the representation of convection at the ASC and SEY stations (5% spread from 2000 to 2003). In contrast to TAP, ensemble spreads at ASC and SEY are largest during biomass burning episodes and relatively small during other months. Averaged over all GMD sites in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and high latitudes, the annual mean ensemble spread in surface CO mixing ratio is 4%; at locations in the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres, variablity is 3% on average while at stations in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and high latitude, variations average only 1% annually. Simulations With Strong and Weak Convective Mass Fluxes In addition to analyzing results from the eight‐member ensemble, we also present a more detailed comparison of the MinConv and MaxConv simulations which produce representations of convective mass flux that are as weak and as strong as is considered reasonable based on the SCM analysis presented by . To highlight differences in vertical transport between the two simulations, we show results from the 4 year averages of July. To place the results of the MaxConv and MinConv simulations in the context of the ensemble, differences between the two simulations are compared to the ensemble spread; differences in multiannual averages greater than the spread are unlikely to be due to internal model variability alone. shows mean convective and grid‐scale vertical mass fluxes calculated during July for the MinConv and MaxConv simulations in the Northern Hemisphere tropics (0° to 15°N). Profiles are calculated from 4 year (2000–2003) multiannual monthly mean quantities which include both convective and nonconvective periods. Large‐scale mass fluxes are averaged separately for positive and negative values. The MaxConv simulation shows a large amount of shallow convective transport occurring below 5 km with less convective mass flux evident at upper levels. In the MinConv simulation, alterations to parameters in the model's moist physics schemes drastically reduce convective transport below 5 km. However, the grid‐scale upward mass flux increases at low levels. Downward grid‐scale mass flux also increased, but by a smaller amount. Above 10 km, grid‐scale upward mass fluxes are larger in the MaxConv simulation than the MinConv simulation which may indicate that stronger convection at low levels facilitates deeper mixing in the upper troposphere. Changes in the strength of parameterized convection also alter horizontal transport in the model. In the MinConv simulation, convergence below 3 km is slightly stronger in the Northern Hemisphere tropics than in the MaxConv simulation ( ). Between 3 and 12.5 km, divergence increases when convection is weaker. These results indicate that weaker parameterized convection may increase the magnitude of grid‐scale horizontal transport at low levels and midlevels. However, between 12.5 and 16.5 km, more divergence occurs in the MaxConv simulation. Grid‐scale upward mass flux at these levels is 20–30% stronger in the MaxConv simulation. These differences may be due in part to differences in tropopause height which is slightly higher in this region in the MaxConv simulation than in the MinConv simulation. Despite considerable changes in convective and grid‐scale mass fluxes, mean CO profiles calculated from both simulations over the same region are largely similar. Between 0° and 15°N during July, zonal mean CO profiles tend to reflect clean air over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans with small contributions from biomass burning over Indonesia and equatorial Africa and South America. In the MaxConv simulation, CO mixing ratios are larger between 2 and 10 km due to stronger convective mixing. Above 15 km, CO mixing ratios are larger in the MaxConv simulation due to a slightly elevated tropopause height. However, at all levels, differences are relatively small (less than 10 ppbv). demonstrated that the largest changes in mass flux between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations occurred below 5 km. In , differences in mass flux between the two simulations in the 2 to 5 km layer are presented in more detail. As is evident in , the changes to parameters in the model's moist physics schemes result in large decreases in convective mass flux in the MinConv simulation. The resulting increases in large‐scale upward grid‐scale mass flux tend to occur in regions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where convective mass fluxes have been diminished. The results suggest that when the magnitude of convection in the tropics is reduced, large‐scale upward motion in the model compensates to some extent. While showed that area mean changes in grid‐scale upward mass flux can be significant (∼50%), shows that in individual grid cells, such increases can be much larger. In some locations in the tropics, total upward mass flux (convective plus grid scale) can be comparable in magnitude in both simulations. However, areas of strong upward motion are more localized in the MinConv simulation than in the MaxConv simulation. In areas outside of the tropics where convection has weakened significantly in the MinConv run (i.e., North America, regions of Europe and Asia), little increase in upward grid‐scale mass flux is found. Changes in parameter values that influence the intensity of convective mass fluxes affect the model's representation of turbulence as well as the large‐scale circulation. shows the mean value of scalar diffusivity during July calculated between 0 and 2 km above the surface in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations. When convection is significantly weakened (as in the MinConv simulation), diffusivity is strongly increased in many regions, particularly over oceans. It should be noted that these differences are smaller than the eight‐member ensemble spread in most regions indicating that they may not be significant. In order to study the collective impact of differences in vertical transport processes in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations, we consider the hypothetical time it would take an air parcel to traverse several atmospheric layers. Hypothetical model transport times were calculated by first estimating a single vertical velocity that includes grid‐scale vertical motion, convective motion (calculated by dividing convective mass flux by air density), and turbulent diffusion (estimated using scalar diffusivity and model layer thickness) for all model layers using monthly mean output; the time required for a parcel to pass upward through each layer was calculated using this velocity and the layer thickness. It should be noted that parameterized processes transport gases instantaneously during a model time step. The hypothetical model transport times are presented as a diagnostic tool to aid in interpretation of the simulations presented in this section and may not accurately represent the time scales of physical transport in the real atmosphere. shows the hypothetical time that would be required for an air parcel to pass from the bottom of the layer to the top for layers from 0 to 2 km, 2 to 5 km, 5 to 8 km, and 8 to 10 km in the MaxConv and MinConv simulations during July (based on 4 year multiannual means). Despite large differences in convective mass fluxes, grid‐scale vertical motion, and turbulent diffusion, the hypothetical model transport times are similar between the two simulations. Below 2 km, the MinConv simulation tends to indicate more rapid ascent in some areas due to stronger turbulence. Between 2 and 5 km, peak transport times (occurring in the ITCZ) are similar between the two simulations though the MaxConv simulation features broader areas of ascent as indicated in . Monthly mean transport times between 5 and 10 km are also similar in the two simulations. shows probability distribution functions (pdfs) computed for the same four atmospheric layers shown in (0–2 km, 2–5 km, 5–8 km, and 8–10 km). Pdfs are computed over all Northern Hemisphere grid boxes. Differences between the MaxConv and MinConv simulation tend to be small near the surface though the MinConv simulation displays slightly shorter residence times due to the increase in diffusivity shown in . In both the 2 to 5 and 5 to 8 km layers, the MaxConv simulation shows a larger proportion of grid cells with residence times less than 3 days than does the MinConv simulation indicating that the stronger convection is more efficient at transporting CO upward through these layers. Between 8 and 10 km, the distribution of transport times is similar between the two simulations though the MaxConv simulations show a slightly larger percentage of grid cells with residence times less than 4 days. Differences in both convective and grid‐scale mass flux between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations result in different ways of transporting CO from source regions. In order to better understand these differences, we examine CO fluxes out of the Indonesian region in 2002. Biomass burning in the region was the strongest during SON. shows the mass of CO during this period integrated from 5°S to the equator and 108°E to 118°E below 1 km. On average during the period presented, the difference in CO mass in the region between the MinConv and MaxConv simulations is only 2%. Additionally, the mass of CO in both simulations displays approximately the same cycle; the reduction in convective mass flux in the MinConv simulation does not result in CO mass remaining at low levels over Indonesia for extended periods of time. The convective, net vertical and net horizontal mass fluxes out of the 1 km vertical “box” region focused over Indonesia are also shown in . As expected, convective transport of CO out of this volume is significantly larger in the MaxConv simulation relative to the MinConv simulation. Net grid‐scale vertical mass fluxes of CO are larger in the MinConv simulation than in the MaxConv simulation throughout the burning period. In addition to increased vertical advective transport of CO, horizontal CO advection out of the Indonesian region is also larger in the MinConv simulation. Two factors may be contributing to changes in advective CO fluxes when convection is weakened. One factor is that when convective transport is weakened, less CO is transported by convection meaning that more CO is available to be transported by either vertical or horizontal winds. The second factor is that when convection is weakened in the model, vertical and horizontal winds are altered (as shown in – ). In order to understand which factor is dominant, we show the percentage of change in vertical and horizontal mass flux when convection is reduced for both CO and air mass flux in . Changes in CO mass flux tend to closely follow changes in air mass flux for both vertical and horizontal transport. When convective mass fluxes are reduced in the MinConv simulation, the grid‐scale vertical mass flux of CO increases by 90% on average during the period; at times, increases can be as large as a factor of four. Vertical air mass flux increases by an average 70% indicating that the majority of the change in vertical CO mass flux is due to changes in the magnitude of vertical winds. Horizontal CO mass flux increases by 40% on average while horizontal air mass flux increases by 27%. Though changes in horizontal winds are smaller than changes in vertical winds, because they are considerably stronger, these changes strongly affect CO distributions and the transport of CO from source regions. Though convective parameter settings strongly reduce convective mass flux, particularly at low levels, they do not impose as strong an influence on total mass flux. In the MinConv simulation, compensating increases in turbulent and upward grid‐scale transport result in transport times comparable in magnitude at many locations to those derived from the MaxConv simulation. As a result, CO distributions in the MinConv and MaxConv simulations are largely similar. shows the zonal mean distribution of CO during April in both simulations (based on 4 year multiannual averages) as well as the difference between the two simulations. Throughout the atmosphere, the CO distributions produced by the MinConv and MaxConv simulations tend to be similar though differences are evident in some locations. The MaxConv simulation produces larger CO mixing ratios in the Northern Hemisphere tropics in the lower troposphere; these differences slant northward with altitude and peak near the tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics. shows zonal mean CO distributions calculated in October. As in April, zonal mean CO distributions produced by the MinConv and MaxConv simulations are similar. A similar feature of enhanced CO in the MaxConv simulation is found in the Northern Hemisphere tropics and subtropics though the peak differences are smaller than in April. Mixing ratios also tend to be larger in the MaxConv simulation in the vicinity of the tropopause and in the lower stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. shows column CO amounts calculated from the MinConv and MaxConv simulations. Column CO is calculated by applying the MOPITT averaging kernels to facilitate comparison with observations shown in . The global distributions of column CO are similar between the two simulations (the global mean for both simulations is 1.5 × 10 18 molecules cm −2 in October and April), though locally differences can be significant. In both April and October, the MaxConv simulation produces more CO over equatorial regions than does the MinConv simulation. This is likely because MOPITT's strongest sensitivity lies in the midtroposphere and the MaxConv simulations more vigorously transports CO from biomass burning source regions to these levels. In April, the MaxConv simulation tends to perform better than the MinConv simulation in the tropics with a lesser degree of underestimation relative to MOPITT. Because the differences in column CO are relatively small between the simulations, it is not possible to identify a single convection scheme tuning as optimal. Summary and Conclusions demonstrated the importance of parameter settings in the GEOS‐5 moist physics schemes in determining convective mass flux and trace gas profiles produced by a single‐column version of the model. Here, we evaluate the impact of changes to these parameters on global CO distributions using 3D GEOS‐5 simulations. The upward transport of CO is influenced not only by the magnitude of mass flux, but also its spatial correlation with CO emissions and their vertical gradients. Because the majority of CO is emitted at the surface and CO is relatively short lived, CO distributions tend to decrease significantly above the boundary layer in source regions. It is this gradient, coupled with alterations in mass flux, that may be expected to alter CO distributions when convective parameters are changed. If, instead of surface sources, CO distributions were dominated by a near constant source throughout the troposphere, changes in updraft mass flux would likely have little impact. An ensemble of eight simulations was constructed by altering values of parameters which found to strongly influence convective mass flux. Analysis of the ensemble results indicates regions where simulated CO distributions are sensitive to alterations in the model representation of convection and where uncertainty introduced into CO distributions by uncertainty in parameterized convection should be considered the greatest. The ensemble spread in column CO amount is typically small though areas near CO source regions and in outflow pathways often display variability greater than in remote regions. Globally, the variability in column CO distributions introduced by alterations to moist physics parameters is less than 3% at most locations. Comparison with an ensemble of simulations produced by initializing simulations with different meteorological fields indicates that over much of the world, altered convective parameters produce variations in CO only slightly larger than those produced by internal model variability. Statistically significant differences in spread between the two ensembles are most likely to occur in tropical outflow pathways where convection is active and large amounts of CO are present. At individual levels, variability in CO mixing ratios introduced by changes in convective parameters can be significantly larger than variability in column CO and the distribution of variability can vary significantly with altitude. The results indicate the importance of interactions between convective detrainment levels and horizontal winds, which can vary strongly with altitude, in determining trace gas distributions. Global plots of the ensemble spread of CO distributions demonstrate that changes in convective parameters have a relatively small influence at remote surface locations such as the sites maintained by NOAA's GMD. The annual mean ensemble spread in surface CO mixing ratio was 4% at Northern Hemisphere midlatitude and high‐latitude sites, 3% at subtropical and tropical sites in both hemispheres, and only 1% at midlatitude and high‐latitude locations in the Southern Hemisphere. These results indicate that inversion studies using remote surface site data are likely relatively insensitive to uncertainty in simulated representations of convection. At some locations, however, variations in CO introduced by changes in the model's moist physics parameters can be significant. At the Tae‐ahn Peninsula, large ensemble spread throughout the year indicates that variations in convection can affect the transport of anthropogenic and biomass burning pollution from Asia. At stations in the Seychelles and Ascension Island, variations associated with convection show a much stronger seasonal dependence associated with annual cycles of biomass burning. In order to gain further insight into the changes in CO mixing ratios introduced by changes in convection, we examined the MaxConv and MinConv simulations in greater detail. Changes in the model's moist physics parameters strongly influence convective mass flux, but also alter grid‐scale vertical and turbulent transport processes. When convective mass flux is reduced in the tropics by altering parameter settings, grid‐scale upward mass flux tends to increase, particularly at low levels. Increases in upward grid‐scale mass flux in the MinConv simulation tend to be focused in regions of the tropics and ITCZ which experience strong convection in the MaxConv simulation. Turbulent diffusion in the boundary layer also strongly increases when convective mass flux is reduced. Though convective mass fluxes are greatly reduced in the MinConv simulation, compensating increases in turbulent and advective transport largely compensate for these decreases, resulting in comparable estimated atmospheric transport times at many locations. As a result, zonal mean CO distributions are remarkably similar between the simulations despite large differences in the roles of various transport processes. Changes in convective and advective transport resulting from parameter changes also influence the transport biomass burning emissions out of the Indonesian region. Though convection is strongly reduced in the MinConv simulation relative to the MaxConv simulation, the mass of CO below 1 km over Indonesia is similar in both simulations. Decreases in convective transport of CO are balanced by increases in vertical and horizontal flux of CO out of the source region. An analysis of CO and air mass flux differences indicate that CO flux changes resulting from weaker convection largely follow changes in air mass fluxes. The results indicate that the dynamical interaction of convection with the grid‐scale vertical and horizontal winds plays a primary role in altering vertical and horizontal CO advection while the increased availability of CO to other transport pathways is secondary in importance. Though the results of this analysis indicate that changes in simulated convection induced by alterations to convective parameters play a relatively small role in determining global CO distributions, it should be noted that this is due in large part to the complex interactions between parameterized convection and other transport processes. Evaluation of the MinConv and MaxConv simulations demonstrate that when transport by parameterized convection is drastically reduced, model dynamics compensate by increasing grid‐scale mass fluxes and boundary layer turbulence. The result is that both simulations produce a realistic climate and largely similar trace gas distributions though the model calculates these answers in very different ways. noted that offline chemical transport model studies which attempt to identify the role of convection in determining trace gas distributions are hindered by the split operator design of most GCMs in which convection is treated both as a sub‐grid‐scale parameterized process and is also partially resolved in large‐scale circulation features such as the Hadley and Walker Cells. In this study, we demonstrate that online GCM studies are also affected. When convective activity produced by the convective parameterization is sharply reduced (as in the MinConv simulation), the large‐scale circulation compensates by increasing activity similar to convection in many of the same regions. Our results support the conclusion of that convective activity cannot be solely attributed to the convective parameterization in a GCM. A number of studies have compared convective mass fluxes produced by different atmospheric models. We have shown that simulations with drastically different convective mass flux profiles can produce similar hypothetical layer residence times and CO distributions. The results presented here suggest that it is important to consider convective mass flux comparisons in the context of total mass flux (including contributions from large‐scale and turbulent transport processes) in attempting to understand intermodel differences in transport. In order to better understand the role of convection in determining trace gas distributions, it may be necessary to categorize processes using model and parameterization independent metrics such as transport time scale or the presence of moisture. In addition, though CO is a useful tracer of convection, our simulations indicate that analysis of CO alone is not always adequate to separate the impacts of different transport processes using these methods. Preliminary studies with radon and carbon dioxide, which are considerably short lived and longer lived, respectively, indicate that the impact of convective parameter changes depends strongly on a number of factors including the lifetime of a trace gas and the seasonal covariation of its sources with physical processes like convection. Shorter‐lived gases are likely to show larger ensemble spreads with less statistical significance (i.e., a stronger influence of internal model variability) while longer‐lived gases show weaker responses to convective changes but greater ability to separate these changes from internal model variability. Future studies which consider multiple trace gases with differing atmospheric lifetimes and varying solubility may help to reduce uncertainty in the role that different transport processes play. The current and next generation of GCMs and chemistry‐climate models which include online transport of chemical species provide an ideal foundation for such studies because they allow full interaction between physical and chemical processes.

Deserts in Gobi and Taklamakan in Mongolia and in northwestern China across East Asia have expanded substantially over the past several decades [ ; ; ]. The socioeconomic and health impacts of the desertification, and consequent transboundary transports of enormous yellow sands originating from those regions are serious concerns not only for China and the adjacent countries in East Asia but also for the western U.S. [ ; ], so that desertification mitigation has been a vital environmental issue across these regions. In order to mitigate the desertification, many efforts have been made such as tree planting, windbreak building, petroleum spraying, and artificial precipitation formation. These methods are likely to have various effects on the local surface and soil characteristics and microclimate through physical changes (e.g., decreased wind speeds, soil erosion, and runoff) and/or thermodynamic changes (e.g., changes in surface energy and water balance). However, it remains equivocal that these efforts have substantial effects on desertification mitigation, inducing satisfactory consequences via the change of land‐atmosphere coupling (e.g., feedback between precipitation and soil moisture or surface temperature) that is a major cause of droughts and desertification in subtropics and midlatitudes. Unfortunately, such a land‐atmosphere coupling cannot readily be changed by land surface changes if the feedback is dominated by dynamic circulations. Therefore, one should pay more attention to a longer‐standing solution, i.e., the changes in hydrological coupling strength between the atmosphere and the land surface changes. The strong land‐atmosphere coupling implies strong dependency of local climates on lands and high vulnerability of the drylands to warm season (April–September) droughts [ , ; ]. This is because the coupling over the drylands is primarily driven by a positive feedback between precipitation and soil moisture (i.e., precipitation deficit and dry soil) and because initial abrupt precipitation deficits are more likely to develop into droughts through this feedback. It has been found that, while warm season droughts tend to be initiated by a precipitation deficit caused by anomalous large‐scale circulations, they are maintained through the positive feedback between the soil moisture and the precipitation over the central U.S. [ ; ; ; ]. This mechanism may also be favorable in the drylands over Mongolia and northern China, with strong hydrological coupling between local precipitation and soil moisture [ ; ; ]. Over these regions, over 60% of the annual precipitation is concentrated on summer [ ]. Thus, rainfall suppression during the warm seasons could easily develop into serious long‐term droughts. For this reason, the coupling strength and its change are particularly sensitive to vulnerability to droughts and, consequently, desertification. Vegetation can modify the coupling strength mainly by changing its evapotranspiration rate, surface energy flux, surface albedo and surface roughness length [ ; ; ; , ]. For example, use of the Community Land Model (CLM) revealed that an increased rate of rain dropping from leaves to the ground was found to enhance the coupling strength over the U.S. [ ]. However, dozens of parameters are associated with vegetation in the CLM, and the vegetation effect on the coupling strength is largely dependent on regional characteristics of soil, vegetation type, local climate, and topography. Accordingly, the integrated impact of vegetation on coupling strength in drylands is worth investigation. Although the coupling strength in East Asian drylands has not yet been investigated, several studies found the climatic impact of vegetation worldwide in various aspects: contributions of forests in the midlatitude to global circulations [e.g., ; ; ], contributions of vegetation to monsoonal circulations in southeastern Asia [e.g., ; ; ], the impacts of afforestation in the Sahel and Amazon regions of the tropics in terms of the changes in surface energy balance, ground and undergroundwater flow, atmospheric water and precipitation, and surface temperature [ ; ; ]. We note that the impacts of deforestation on climate and water supplies have been also studied extensively [ ; ; ], but the hydrological and thermodynamic influences of deforestation may not be the exact opposite to those of afforestation. The vegetation effect on modulating the coupling strength has implication of afforestation policy to mitigate desertification. To use a metaphor, this effect of afforestation may be compared with oriental herb treatment that aims to cure the root causes of disease and improve the physical constitution of the human body rather than focus on removing disease symptoms. Additionally, if the modulation of the coupling strength occurs not remotely but locally, identifying a region with maximal vegetation‐induced changes in coupling strength will be of great use to policy makers because they can determine the most effective tree planting regions. This is indeed important for those with limited economic and human resources. In this regard, this concentrated tree planting is what we refer to as “acupuncture‐like afforestation.” Based on the aforementioned rationale, we first investigates the impact of vegetation on the land‐atmosphere coupling over the entire study region in East Asia. Then we will suggest the tree planting with due consideration of the land‐atmosphere coupling for desertification mitigation within the study region. Experiment Design and Computation of Coupling Strength This study is based on the coupled model simulation: the regional climate model (Weather Research Forecasting model 3.0; WRF) coupled with the land surface model (CLM model 3.5) from University of California at Berkeley is employed with 6 h NCEP final analysis (FNL) data for initial and boundary conditions. In this model, the land soil is represented by 17 soil texture types, which determine the thermal and hydrologic soil properties. The terrestrial vegetation is described by 16 Plantation Functional Types (PFTs). The land use data set of USGS provided by the WRF preprocessing system was used, which allowed for 24 land use categories that are determined by the combination of bare ground and several PFT types. Vegetation phenology is provided from the vegetation fraction of the monthly averaged USGS data. The PFTs characterize properties including solar radiation, soil root distribution, aerodynamics at the vegetation‐atmosphere interface, and photosynthesis rates [ ]. The spatial distributions of the most and second dominant PFTs within the domain of the study are shown in and , respectively, with the summer (June, July, and August, or JJA) mean vegetation fraction shown in . also displays four subregions of interest: the eastern edges of the Gobi desert in the north central domain (NC), the Manchurian Plains in northeastern China (NE), the urban areas (Beijing and Tianjin) of central China (UC), and the crop regions of south central China (SC). The region, SC, is included due to substantial changes in coupling strength as shown later in this manuscript, though having a subtropical climate. A short summary on the local climate and major vegetation types in each selected region is listed in . The model domain has 141 × 141 grid points with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 km. The physical parameterization schemes used in this study are the Kain‐Fritsch convective parameterization scheme, WSM3 cloud microphysics scheme, RRTM long‐wave radiation scheme, MM5 long‐wave radiation scheme, and YSU planetary boundary layer scheme. This study employs two different experiments: CLM default prescribed vegetation (VEG experiment) and bare ground (NOVEG experiment). While, in the VEG experiment, each grid is assigned by both bare ground and several PFTs up to four, all the PFTs in a grid was set to zero (i.e., bare ground) in the NOVEG experiment. Once calculations are performed at the PFT level in the CLM, fluxes of energy, water, and momentum are aggregated at the grid cell level and passed to the WRF. The WRF provides atmospheric components such as wind, temperature, humidity, pressure, and number of radiations at the lowest level to the CLM. The CLM then calculates surface energy, albedo, momentum, and radiation fluxes and updates the soil hydrologic states based on these fluxes, which are then passed back to the WRF. The simulation period was from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Output data from 1 January to 30 November 2000 are discarded as a spin‐up period; in the rest, 4 year outputs were used for the analysis. To investigate the effects of vegetation on hydrological land‐atmospheric coupling, this study focuses on monthly anomalies of precipitation ( P ′) and evapotranspiration ( E ′) and coupling strength (CS). Based on the study of , the hydrological CS is calculated using the equation as follows: _placeholder_formula_ Here, i is the number of months; P ′ is the 30 day anomaly of precipitation (mm/d) with a 5 day moving interval; and E ′ is the 30 day anomaly of evapotranspiration (mm/d) with a 5 day moving interval. The anomalies P ′ and E ′ are computed based on 4 year averages of monthly (i.e., 30 day) precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. The total number of months ( N ) is 52 (13 cases × 4 years) (e.g., 1–30 June, 5 June to 4 July, 10 June to 9 July, 1–30 August). The CS estimates the fractional contribution of the covariance between precipitation and evapotranspiration deviations to variance of the precipitation deviations. The greater contribution of E ′ to P ′, and vice versa, for the same variance of P ′ leads to a higher CS. The analysis was performed only for JJA and for regions with rainfall ≥1.5 mm/d in this study. This is because the impacts of vegetation are the most pronounced in the summer and because CS computation is meaningless over regions with extremely low rainfall rates, which is the case over the most northern domains in the other seasons. Results Impact of Vegetation on Mean and Variability of Hydrological Variables shows JJA mean precipitation ( _placeholder_formula_ ) and evapotranspiration ( _placeholder_formula_ ) of the VEG experiment for 2001–2004 and their differences (Δ) between the VEG and NOVEG experiments (Δ _placeholder_formula_ and Δ _placeholder_formula_ ). In general, the WRF‐CLM model simulates well 4 year summer climatology of P and E over most of East Asia ( and ), both in the magnitude and geographical distribution, compared with observations (not shown). For both _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ , strong gradients between the northwestern and southeastern regions are also found in observations. The model has a tendency to overestimate rainfall along the southern boundary of the domain ( ). Despite some heterogeneous spatial patterns, vegetation tends to increase both precipitation and evapotranspiration over the northwestern regions, but to decrease them over the southern regions ( and ), consequently diminishing the northwest‐southeast gradients. These differences between VEG and NOVEG are statistically significant over most of the model domain at a 95% confidence level. On the other hand, changes in _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ are expected to contribute to changes in soil moisture in a transition zone between dry and humid regions; namely, higher _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ is likely to induce wetter soil. displays _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ ( ) and soil moisture differences in the top 1.8 cm layer ( _placeholder_formula_ ) ( ). Comparison of with indicates that spatial patterns of the difference of _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ are not identical to those of _placeholder_formula_ , while extremely high _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ is responsible for the increase of _placeholder_formula_ in some regions (e.g., the eastern part of NE and the areas between UC and SC). This result suggests that soil moisture changes associated with changes in vegetation are only partly controlled by mean changes in _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ . The impact of vegetation is also present upon variability of P and E , which is illustrated in showing standard deviations of monthly P ′ and E ′ ( σ ( P ′), and σ ( E ′)) and their differences (Δ σ ( P ′), and Δ σ ( E ′)) between the VEG and NOVEG experiments. As to precipitation, σ ( P ′) is similar to _placeholder_formula_ in terms of a northwest‐southeast gradient ( and ). However, as to evapotranspiration, the similarity between σ ( E ′) and _placeholder_formula_ is unclear ( and ). Spatial patterns of Δ σ ( P ′) ( ) are rather distinct from those of Δ _placeholder_formula_ , especially over the Gobi desert in the northwestern regions of the domain ( ). Discrepancy in the vegetation‐induced differences between the mean and the variance of evapotranspiration ( and ) is noticeable mainly in the Gobi desert and the central China. The values Δ σ ( E ′) appear to be statistically significant over the four sub study regions at the 95% level ( ), while the values Δ σ ( P ′) are less significant ( ). These characteristics indicate that vegetation affects both mean and variability of precipitation and evapotranspiration, but with different sensitivity to regions. A significant amount of literature investigating the response of precipitation to the changes in vegetation discussed in the review paper of mostly tackled issues associated with the mean changes in precipitation. In this study, we focus on the variability rather than the mean of the hydrological variables because CS is dependent on their anomalies only, as defined in . Modulation of Vegetation on Coupling Strength The CS of the VEG and NOVEG experiments in JJA and the differences between the VEG and NOVEG experiments are displayed in . Although CS in is based on the model output of WRF‐CLM, the spatial pattern and magnitudes of CS are very similar to the coupling strength computed by ECMWF reanalysis in , Figure 1] despite both analyses in different time periods and different data resolutions. While CS is higher over the northern domain than the southern domain because of the limited availability of soil moisture ( ), VEG had a lower CS than did NOVEG in most of the domain ( ). Over the three selected areas (NE, UC, and SC) in particular, the reduction rate of CS by inclusion of vegetation ranged from 40% to 85% ( ). In contrast, a higher CS was identified over the eastern edges of the Gobi desert (NC) (18% increase; ). A student's t test for the difference of CSs computed for each summer of 2001–2004 (p value in ) indicates that the differences in the negative regions (NE, UC, and SC) are statistically significant at the 95% level. The opposite response of CS to vegetation is partially attributed to the characteristics of the present major vegetation types (i.e., crop and needleleaf evergreen temperate tree (NETT) in NE, UC, and SC versus grass in NC as shown in and and in ) since the combination of crop/grass as the first/second PFTs in and (e.g., the southwestern NE and UC neighborhoods and the south central SC) tends to hamper the reduction of CS compared to the combination of crop/NETT (e.g., the central NE and UC and the eastern SC). Moreover, replacing the grass with crops in NC in an additional experiment resulted in negative CS differences (not shown), which is opposite to the result in . Nevertheless, not every crop/NETT combination area shows significant decreases in CS, including the southern parts and the northeastern parts of SC, which implies the significance of other factors that are responsible for the differences in CS other than the dominant vegetation types (e.g., soil type, topography, land‐atmosphere interactions, and transport of air and moisture). The substantial reductions in CS by the inclusion of vegetation, such as in NE, UC, and SC, indicates that the vegetation contributes to desertification mitigation. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the changes in CS significantly affect regional hydrological characteristics and aridity. Studies on warm season droughts over the transition zones in the midlatitude suggest that, although long‐lasting serious droughts are initiated by abnormal large‐scale circulations, the significant roles of the land surface interactions with the atmosphere cannot be neglected since they maintain and amplify the initial droughts, which leads to long‐lasting droughts [ ]. Considering this mechanism of droughts, the presence of a CS reduction theoretically implies that those regions can be affected not only by less intense but also by less frequent summer droughts due to vegetation since the positive feedback between the atmosphere and the land surface is less likely to amplify an original precipitation deficit. This speculation is consistent with the changes of JJA mean soil moisture, _placeholder_formula_ ( ). Moisture in the soil of the top layer is highly variable and directly influences surface evapotranspiration and energy flux. It is a reliable proxy for drought indices such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) over snow‐free regions [ ] in that it reflects the aggregate effect of the hydrologic processes in the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere as well as their interactions at various time scales. shows that lower CS is coincident with wetter soil in NE, UC, and SC, and vice versa in NC. The difference of _placeholder_formula_ between VEG and NOVEG was statistically significant at the 95% level in the four sub study regions. The wetter soil in the VEG over NE, UC, and SC might result from increased JJA mean of precipitation minus evapotranspiration ( _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ ) as well, as discussed previously in the . However, the difference in _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was negative ( ), and the impact of vegetation on _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was inconsistent with that on _placeholder_formula_ over those study regions. The difference between _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ was not fully explained by changes in runoff (not shown). These results are interesting because the difference (VEG minus NOVEG) of mean soil moisture appears to be linked with those of CS that is based on the anomalies of P and E. Thus, the opposite tendency of the differences in CS and soil moisture shown in alludes that CS reduction decreases local vulnerability to drought by changing the land‐atmosphere feedback characteristics and local climate, which ultimately tends to alleviate desertification in East Asia. Identification of the Most Effective Regions of Tree Planting While vegetation tends to modulate local coupling strength significantly, the impact of vegetation on the CS as shown in may be subject to vegetation fraction since the VEG experiment implemented the vegetation close to current status in CLM. In an attempt to remove this dependency, the difference of CS (VEG minus NOVEG) divided by the JJA mean vegetation fraction (shown in ) is calculated and shown in (normalized difference of CS; NDCS). Comparison of with demonstrates that while NDCS is slightly reduced over the densely distributed vegetation regions such as the northeastern and southwestern domains, a strong reduction of NDCS is still predominant over the regions where the difference in the nonnormalized CS ( ) is large. In particular, NDCS is significantly noticeable over the areas with vegetation fractions <50% (indicated by black contours in ). These areas include the eastern peripheries of Gobi desert, Manchurian Plains (NE), and fast urbanization areas in central China (UC). In particular, NE and UC are acknowledged as being the most hazardous regions in which the fast transition from greenness to aridness has occurred over the past several decades [ ]. suggests that tree planting over these regions would reduce CS more considerably than would planting over the other regions and mitigate desertification of East Asia in terms of atmosphere‐land coupling. For the identification and suggestion of the most effective regions for tree planting in to be valid, the impact of afforestation on CS should be a locally oriented process (i.e., changes in evapotranspiration) rather than a remotely oriented process (i.e., large‐scale circulation and associated moisture flux divergence). One way to test this hypothesis is to determine whether moisture transports from other regions play an important role in precipitation variability. If vegetation‐induced CS changes are mainly associated with great changes in moisture flux divergence ( MFD , hereafter) instead of evapotranspiration, the influence of afforestation on CS occurs remotely and then the local modulation of CS in one area becomes sensitive to the specific locations of the trees planted elsewhere. In this case, finding the most effective tree planting areas requires a complicated set of model experiments, and the result is less reliable. Neglecting surface runoff and drainage, P , E , and MFD are interrelated according to the approximation of the surface hydrologic balances on a monthly time scale ( MFD = P − E ) and; thus, monthly anomalous MFD ( MFD ′) was estimated from the monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration. displays the differences in the area‐averaged standard deviations of MFD ′ between VEG and NOVEG [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] in each selected region. Similarly, [Δ σ ( P ′)] and [Δ σ ( E ′)] for the anomalies of P and E , respectively. Although [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] is commensurate with that of [Δ σ ( E ′)] in magnitude over NC, indicates not only that the absolute magnitudes of [Δ σ ( MFD ′)] are much less than those of [Δ σ ( E ′)] but also that [Δ σ ( P ′)] are mainly related with [Δ σ ( E ′)] in sign over NE, UC, and SC. The former result implies the smaller magnitudes of MFD ′ compared to P ′ and E ′, because P ′, E ′, and MFD ′ are quantities of anomalies and their standard deviations are likely to be proportional to their absolute magnitudes. When the surface runoff and drainage are also taken into account, the MFD ′ magnitudes are expected to be even smaller than those shown in . Although this analysis does not completely eliminate the possibility of remote impact of afforestation on CS in other regions, the result in is indicative of the fact that vegetation controls the CS rather locally. In this respect, provides valuable information about the most effective regions of tree planting for desertification mitigation in terms of atmosphere‐land CS. Causes on the Changes in Coupling Strength According to , it is reasonable to assume that the differences of CS may be associated with changes of signs in P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i and/or absolute magnitude of CS . For the numerator (∑ i =1 N P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ), changes can be induced by either or both of the following: (1) changes in number of cases with opposite signs between P ′ and E ′, thus with a negative sign of P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i (decoupling frequency, hereafter), and (2) changes in the sign‐neglected magnitude of P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i (=∣ P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ∣). Change of decoupling frequency is higher in UC and SC (14.8% and 14.6%, respectively) than in NC and NE (−3.1%, and 8.7%, respectively), but it is less than 15%. On the other hand, the original CS and the sign‐neglected CS averaged over the selected regions for the VEG and NOVEG experiments are shown in . Differences in the original CS are the same values as shown in . For either VEG or NOVEG, the sign‐neglected CS was higher than the original CS, especially in UC and SC, but the VEG‐NOVEG differences did not change much between the original case and the sign‐neglected case; in fact, they remained almost the same in NE and NC and slightly increased in UC and SC. This result implies that the changes in the absolute magnitude of CS is more critical to the induction of significant CS changes between VEG and NOVEG than the changes in decoupling frequency. Changes in CS may be more sensitive to changes in the value of the denominator than those in the numerator. displays area‐averaged amounts of numerators (sign‐neglected value, ∑ i =1 N ∣ P ′ i ⋅ E ′ i ∣) and denominators (∑ i =1 N P ′ i 2 ) and their differences (%) between VEG and NOVEG. In all of the selected regions, numerator changes were much greater than denominator changes, which consequently determine the signs of the CS differences. Furthermore, changes in the absolute magnitude of CS are attributed to larger changes in E ′ than in P ′. This feature is supported by , which shows the differences (in percent) of the area‐averaged standard deviations of P ′ and E ′ between VEG and NOVEG (Δ P ′ and Δ E ′) in each selected region. Here, Δ P ′ and Δ E ′ were computed as: _placeholder_formula_ Note that first, Δ P ′ and Δ E ′ are close estimates of the difference of absolute magnitudes of P ′ and E ′ between VEG and NOVEG. Second, the magnitude of P ′ tends to be inversely proportional to CS due to the cancellation effect of P ′ in the numerator by P ′ 2 in the denominator in , but the magnitude of E ′ is proportional to CS. According to , in NC, where ΔCS is positive in and , the positive changes of CS stems from the larger increase in E ′, while the increase in P ′ tends to decrease CS. Similarly, in the other three regions (NE, UC, and SC), where ΔCS is negative, the reduction of CS is mainly caused by larger decreases in E ′ despite the decrease in P ′. This analytical result is indicative of the significant modulation of vegetation on CS, primarily through modifying the evapotranspiration variability. This is confirmed by the variability changes of evapotranspiration in corresponding with the changes of CS in over most of the domain. Evapotranspiration in CLM is a complex function of several variables, such as surface wind speed, temperature, humidity, and aerodynamic leaf and surface resistance. Furthermore, on a daily or monthly time scale, complicated interactions arise between land surface variables in CLM and atmospheric variables in WRF by coupling the models with the land surface and by boundary layer processes as described in the . This is why CS responds differently over the same PFT regions as discussed in . Declines of the standard deviation of evapotranspiration anomalies signify that the vegetation helps keep the evapotranspiration constant. The soil moisture memory in the dry areas appears to be short because its water‐holding capacity is low due to its sparse vegetation; as such, it is probable that planting trees over these regions would affect evapotranspiration, runoff, and, ultimately, soil moisture [ ; ]. Indeed, supporting this speculation, the longer memory of the top 1.8 cm soil layer in the VEG compared to the NOVEG experiment was discovered over dry regions of East Asia in this study (not shown). As a result, combination of the results in and suggests that vegetation is likely to alter local evapotranspiration and precipitation variability and then change the atmosphere‐land CS in the dry lands of East Asia. Discussion and Conclusions This study investigated the impact of vegetation on the hydrological coupling between land and atmosphere, based on the simulations of the WRF‐CLM coupled model. We found that vegetation is predisposed to reduce the atmosphere‐land linkage and to increase soil moisture over the several dry and wet regions in East Asia. This potential impact of vegetation is worth taking into account, because various attempts to mitigate desertification have been made, with the fundamental concepts of drought and desertification (i.e., maintenance of droughts by strong feedbacks between the atmosphere and land) missing. This study reports for the first time, to our knowledge, the indirect but fundamental impact of vegetation on the CS between the atmosphere and the land surface. The most important hydrological factor in the CS change by vegetation appears to be evapotranspiration: vegetation tends to reduce the variability of evapotranspiration like a water reservoir in the soil and then diminish the CS. The vegetation‐induced CS declines result in enhanced JJA mean soil moisture ( ), suggesting decreases in drought intensity and/or occurrence. However, this effect is limited in some regions such as the northern central domain (NC). Although our VEG and NOVEG experiments are not ideal for directly describing afforestation effects, this result suggests that an afforestation effect may have a unique contribution to desertification mitigation. After testing the regional dependency of the impact of vegetation on CS, this study ultimately suggests several key regions including the Manchurian Plains (NE) and the rapid urbanization areas in central China (UC) as the most efficient areas for vegetation planting with respect to CS reduction. Identification of the most influential areas of afforestation with respect to the modification of the land‐atmosphere CS and the tree planting over those areas is referred to as the acupuncture‐like afforestation. While previous studies regarding deforestation and afforestation have focused on the impacts of vegetation on changes in the mean characteristics of surface temperature, precipitation, surface energy fluxes or large‐ and local‐scale circulations, this study emphasizes the significance of the hydrological coupling strength that takes into account only the anomalies of precipitation and evapotranspiration. One may expect that the increase in _placeholder_formula_ or _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ would be more important to mitigate desertification. However, with respect to hydrological extreme events such as floods and droughts, the climate variability rather than its average has been considered to be more important [ ; ]. Furthermore, changes in the climate variability (e.g., coupling strength) would induce a substantial change in the averages in a longer time scale, ultimately. We found that JJA mean soil moisture can increase, despite decreased _placeholder_formula_ − _placeholder_formula_ in many East Asian regions where the reduction of CS by vegetation was pronounced ( ). Namely, the mean precipitation is not always directly associated with the probability of drought over dry lands. We, therefore, demonstrated that changes in CS rather than those in the mean precipitation by tree planting are more decisive for desertification mitigation. This study revisited the conventional tree planting approach as an essential and effective strategy for desertification mitigation with respect to the hydrological coupling strength. One of the drawbacks of this study is lack of complete mechanical explanations about the connections between CS and soil moisture. It is necessary to further investigate detailed processes of the modulation of soil moisture by CS. Specifically, further studies require careful and profound analyses considering complete hydrological cycles among the atmosphere, soil, and vegetation with respect to both mean and anomaly fields of hydrological variables, based on much longer simulations than 5 years. This remains to be investigated as the future study. Another drawback of this study is related with a dependency of vegetation species on CS. Based on the effect of the currently dominant vegetation types on the CS, this study focused on the question of where to plant to combat desertification. The question of which species strengthen or weaken CS in terms of desertification mitigation remains significant, although it is suggested that crop (grass) is likely to weaken (intensify) CS ( and ) in this study. Unfortunately, adaptation of the multiple PFTs at a grid in CLM prevents further analyses from finding the answers to the latter question. In addition, assuming prescribed vegetation, interactions and feedback between vegetation and climate are not considered in this study. Therefore, future studies should enlighten the dependency of vegetation species and the impact of interactions between vegetation and climate on CS. This study dealt with the climatic impact of vegetation in the present climate only. However, many future projections of the double CO 2 environments using general circulation models (GCMs) show that the short‐term and long‐term drought frequencies would increase greatly over the globe since they are associated with changes in Hadley circulations and northward replacement of major storm tracks in the northern hemisphere [ ; ]. Especially over the Mediterranean and southern Europe, one of the high‐risk frequent drought regions, enhanced precipitation‐temperature‐soil moisture coupling in the double CO 2 climate has been simulated [ ; ]. In this circumstance, the acupuncture‐like afforestation is expected to lessen the potential impacts of global warming on drought probability and desert expansion. This study examined only the vegetation‐induced hydrological coupling between the atmosphere and land surface, especially during the summer, although desertification can also be locally affected by nonmeteorological factors e.g., chemical and biological deterioration of the soil [ ; ; ] and changes in land use due to grazing, cultivation, and fire [ ] induced by human interferences. However, these nonmeteorological factors may eventually alter CS through various effects as well and can affect desertification. Consequently, one has to be attentive to CS modulation and its influences on desertification mitigation.

We thank anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on an earlier draft of this article."},{"id":5,"value":"Introduction Changes in vegetation greenness have been recognized as modifying the climate and the energy budget of the earth through both biophysical and biochemical processes [ Bonan , ; Levis , ]. However, the role of vegetation in influencing hydro‐climate is very controversial, and debates on this topic are usually divided into “demand‐side” and “supply‐side” schools [ Ellison et al ., ]. The “demand‐side” school suggests that an increase in vegetation could consume water and reduce runoff, which would lead to a water availability decline, especially in small‐scale regions, while the “supply‐side” school argues that the overall impacts of vegetation, particularly forests, are positive for water supply. For example, Makarieva and Gorshkov [ , ] hypothesized that a “biotic pump” mechanism in continuous extensive natural forests far from coasts but having extensive borders with larger water bodies may exist. They argued that those forest covers, though far from oceans, could attract and pump moisture back into the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration (ET), and then, the rate at which moisture is recirculated in the form of ET may in turn have an impact on the frequency and duration of precipitation events. Although different perspectives exist, it is thought that vegetation greenness is inextricably linked to atmospheric water vapor. Until now, most studies have emphasized the role of the “biotic pumps” of interior forests from the coastal regions in altering moisture transportation and even atmospheric circulation, and several observations have been cited to support this claim [ Angelini et al ., ; Makarieva et al ., ; Makarieva et al ., ; Spracklen et al ., ; Viste and Sorteberg , ; Sheil and Murdiyarso , ; Makarieva et al ., ]. However, the number of studies exploring the effects of vegetation on changes in atmospheric water shortage (e.g., precipitable water, or PW) is small [ McGuire et al ., ]. Although some modeling studies have recently indicated that the climatic effect of changes in long‐wave radiation flux brought about by additional water vapor through ET, due to increased vegetation in middle‐high northern latitudes, cannot be neglected, particularly in water‐limited regions [ Rotenberg and Yakir , ; Swann et al ., ; Swann et al ., ], direct evidence has still not been obtained. Water vapor plays a major role as a dominant feedback variable in the hydrological cycle and in radiative forcing, which impacts both global and local weather as well as climate. Water vapor in the lower troposphere not only acts as the main resource for precipitation in all weather processes by providing latent heating [ Trenberth et al ., ], but also influences the planetary radiative balance through cloud formation. Moreover, as a natural, important, and abundant greenhouse gas, water vapor helps maintain the Earth's surface temperature by absorbing and emitting long‐wave infrared radiation, which exerts a positive feedback on the changing climate system and strengthens the greenhouse effect [ Sudradjat et al ., ]. Therefore, it is important to seek evidence of the impact of vegetation on PW by analyzing various data. China is located within the Asian monsoon region, meaning that its moisture content and transportation are essentially controlled by monsoon circulations. During the summer (June, July, and August (JJA)), the Asian summer monsoons (east/south) bring abundant moisture to most of mainland China and influence its precipitation pattern [ Simmonds et al ., ]. The moisture pattern in northern China, particularly in the arid/semi‐arid parts of northwestern China, is also impacted by the westerly belt as well as by the ecosystem [ Sato et al ., ; Song and Zhang , ; Wu et al ., ]. Li et al . [ ] and Zheng et al . [ ] have noted that more attention needs to be paid to the influence of the land‐cover and land use changes as well as other anthropogenic activities on moisture patterns. In the last three decades, China has launched large‐scale ecosystem restoration programs (e.g., the Three‐North Forest Shelterbelt Program, the Grain for Green project, and the Natural Forest Conservation Program) [ Liu et al ., , ; Wang et al ., ], especially in its northern regions, to combat environmental deterioration. Because of these efforts, forest cover has increased dramatically from 8% in 1949 to 18.2% in 2005 [ Cao et al ., ]. Northern China encompasses the three geographic regions of northwestern, northern, and northeastern China. These regions are severely short of water, especially the northwest. Annual precipitation is less than 400 mm over most of this region, even less than 200 mm in the northwest and therefore northern China is usually defined as a water‐limited region. Because of the water shortages, the climatic effects of changes in vegetation greenness in this region have attracted worldwide attention. Previous studies of the impact of vegetation greenness change on climate in China have ranged from modeling [ Bi et al ., ; Liu et al ., , ; Yu et al ., ; Zheng et al ., ] to observational analysis [ Duan et al ., ; Wu et al ., ; Yang et al ., ], but few have explored changes in water vapor in relation to the vegetation greenness change. Rangwala et al . [ ] found that warming in the Tibetan Plateau has possibly been influenced by increases in water vapor, but the contributions of vegetation greenness change were not explored in their study. This study aims to investigate whether water vapor has been significantly influenced by vegetation greenness changes in the summer (JJA) over northern China and to explore the possible physical mechanisms. Details of the data sets used in this study and the analytical approach selected are provided in . describes the observed variations in water vapor in China, explores the relationship between water vapor and vegetation greenness, and discusses possible physical mechanisms for this relationship. provides concluding remarks. Methodology Data and Study Region Vegetation greenness can be characterized using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data [ Liang et al ., ]. This research used the monthly, 8 km Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies NDVI products from 1982 to 2008, which are derived from data of the Advanced High Resolution Radiometer on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar‐orbiting satellite [ Tucker et al ., ]. This data set has been widely used for research purposes. Monthly ET satellite products from 1983 to 2006 can be obtained from Zhang et al . [ ]. Meteorological precipitation monthly gridded products from 1982 to 2008 can be obtained from the Climatic Research Unit [ Mitchell and Jones , ]. Three PW data sets were validated to determine which worked best over China. These data sets included the NASA Modern Era Retrospective‐Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) [ Rienecker et al ., ], the NCEP Climate Forest System Reanalysis (NCEP/CFSR; [ Saha et al ., ]), and the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA‐Interim; [ Dee et al ., ]) with processed radiosonde station measurements by Dai et al . [ ] within China, station by station. The results are shown in Figure , which illustrates that in the summer in China, the accuracy of PW from MERRA was the most satisfactory. Therefore, the MERRA PW data set was selected for analysis in this research. All grid data sets have been aggregated into 0.5° × 0.5°, monthly data sets, and nonvegetated grids have been excluded [ Ma and Frank , ]. The 14 northern provinces in China were selected to represent northern China, as indicated in Figure . This area is considered to be one of the most environmentally vulnerable regions in China [ Huang et al ., ] and is characterized by a dry climate, severe water shortages, and land degradation. The last consists primarily of desertification caused by wind erosion, especially in the northern and northwestern parts. Except for the northeastern region, the major types of vegetation in this area are grasses and shrubs. Circulation Indices Most of the moisture over China is controlled by atmospheric circulations. The Asian summer monsoon (east/south) and the northern mid‐high latitude westerly circulation are the main sources of moisture [ Zhang et al ., ]. Therefore, the three atmospheric circulation indices used in this study include the East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI), the South Asian Summer Monsoon Index (SASMI), and the Westerly Index (WI). The EASMI is a shear vorticity index, which is defined by U850 averaged in (22.5°N–32.5°N, 110°E–140°E) minus U850 in (5°N–15°N, 90°E–130°E), where U850 is the zonal wind averaged over the summer season (June‐August) at 850 hPa. This index is the Wang and Fan [ ] index with a reverse sign and was recommended by Wang et al . [ ]. The SASMI is an improved index developed by Shi et al . [ ] based on the Webster and Yang index [ Webster and Yang , ]. The improved SASMI is the optimal linear combination of the zonal wind shear U850 averaged in (7.5°N–20°N, 37.5°E–90°E) and U200 averaged in (5°N–35°N, 40°E–90°E), expressed as (2.4U850–U200), where U850 and U200 denote the zonal wind average over the season (June‐September) at 850 hPa and 200 hPa, respectively. WI is an index which measures the strength of the midlatitude westerly circulation and was developed by Rossby [ ]. Here WI was calculated as _placeholder_formula_ [ Wu et al ., ], where H denotes the zonal‐average height at 500 hPa. According to Li et al . [ ] and Yan et al . [ ], three regions were selected for calculating the regional summer (June‐August) WI i (i=1,2,3) (region1: 30°E–70°E; region2: 70°E–110°E; region3:110°E–140°E), which have a close relationship with the hydro‐climate within China. All the indices were generated using the MERRA reanalysis data for consistency. Statistical Methods Several statistical methods were used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of the variables and their linkages in the summer from 1982 to 2008. Because the PW has a very short memory, only the simultaneous effects of variables were considered in the following analysis. The analysis proceeded in four steps. First, linear regression was carried out to analyze trends in summer NDVI and PW over China during this period. Second, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was conducted for summer PW anomalies. The EOF method is thought to be one of the most effective ways to explore the spatiotemporal structure of the long‐term variations of a variable over a specific area and is based on the covariance matrix. The summer PW anomalies were derived by removing the annual cycle (subtracting long‐term mean values) from all grid point time series. Third, Pearson's correlation was used to explore coupling between variables. To determine whether there is a persistent trend in the summer for northern China's PW and NDVI activity, a piecewise linear regression model [ Toms and Lesperance , ] was used to detect their turning points (TPs) in the fourth step. The model used is: _placeholder_formula_ where t is the year, y is summer (JJA) PW or NDVI, α is the TP of the summer PW or NDVI trend, β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 are regression coefficients, and ϵ; is the residual of the fit. The summer linear PW or NDVI trend is β 1 before the TP and β 1 + β 2 after it. α was determined by the least squares error method. TP was confined to the period from 1986 to 2002 to avoid linear regression in one period with too few data points, and the significance of TP was tested using a t test. A p value <0.1 was considered significant. For more details, the readers can refer to Wang et al . [ ]. These methods cannot quantify the effect of NDVI on PW. To explore further how terrestrial vegetation changes have impacted PW, it is necessary to consider the impacts of atmospheric circulations and the TP of PW together. Based on this assertion and the assumption that the relationship is linear, two scenarios were represented: The first takes into account only the influence of the circulations and can be written as: _placeholder_formula_ where ϵ; represents the residuals (or errors) of the regression; a , b , c , and d m are regression coefficients, which are estimated pixel by pixel by the ordinary least squares (OLS) method; X m(m=1,2,…,5) contains the circulation indices EASMI, SASMI, and WI i=1,2,3 , and optimal stepwise linear regression is used to select the most relevant circulation indices based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The variables “year” and “α” are included in equation to account for a possible trend and TP in the PW. This equation states that year‐to‐year changes in PW during the summer are linearly related to year‐to‐year changes in the atmospheric circulations. The second scenario incorporates the same variables and the observed summer NDVI together: _placeholder_formula_ This interactive scenario clarifies the influence of NDVI on PW, in which X m are the optimal selected circulation indices from equation , and all the coefficients were also estimated by the OLS. Finally, F‐test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the coefficient e in equation , which indicates to what extent a relation exists. The nature of this effect is indicated by the sign of e ; a positive value indicates that increases in NDVI increases PW. Results and Analysis The analytical results of the spatiotemporal variations and coupling between summer PW and NDVI in the study region are presented in this section. The effect of NDVI on PW has also been quantified. As a deeper analysis, the relations between ET, PW, and P are also explored to help clarify the physical mechanisms involved. Changes in Summer PW The first step was to examine the geographical distribution of the mean and the linear trend of summer PW based on the MERRA reanalysis data from 1982 to 2008 at the national scale, as shown in Figure . The spatial distribution of the summer PW means in Figure a indicates an obvious decreasing trend from east to west in China. The Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Gansu, and the southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region desert areas within western China show PW values less than 10 mm, while other eastern regions, which are mostly influenced by the Asian monsoon, have relatively abundant water vapor. Figure b shows the spatial pattern of summer PW trends during the same period with an average rate of 0.057 mm yr −1 . This means a general increasing trend in PW in most of China, and in several areas located in western China, such as the central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. To prove the reliability of the MERRA PW products further, the results for the linear trend of PW radiosonde measurements are also shown in Figure c, which show a generally similar pattern to Figure b. In other words, the dry arid/semi‐arid regions within northern China (delineated by the black line in Figure ) have been becoming moister in the last three decades. In addition to the 27 year climatology and summer PW trend, an examination of the spatiotemporal pattern of PW changes over the whole of northern China is interesting. An EOF analysis was conducted of the anomalies in summer PW from 1982 to 2008. Figure shows the first three leading modes of PW, which together explain 96.85% of the total variance. The first mode accounts for 67.72% of the variance; its spatial pattern (Figure a) is generally characterized by a same positive sign over the whole study region, while its corresponding Principal Component (PC) time series (Figure d) shows a generally increasing trend throughout the analysis period. This indicates that summer PW over northern China is most likely increasing. According to Zhai and Eskridge [ ] and Xie et al . [ ], this trend is strongly coupled with an increasing trend in surface temperature in the warm season. Moreover, there appears to be an increasing trend until 2000 and a relatively stable situation afterwards. The second mode (Figure b), which explains 23.63% of the variance, seems to separate the signal into a west‐east pattern. It is characterized by positive anomalies in the northern and northwestern arid/semi‐arid regions west of 110°E and negative anomalies in northeastern part of China and the southeastern and southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region. The associated PC time series in Figure e shows a sudden increasing trend after the mid to late1990s, reflecting an apparent strengthening in PW over the western arid/semi‐arid regions and a steady decrease in northeastern China since the mid‐1990s. Although the third mode of PW (Figure c) explains 5.50% of the variance, it indicates subregional dipole‐like PW changes from west to east. The corresponding time series (Figure f) shows an interannual variation and also a TP around the mid‐1990s. The three modes together reflect different patterns of PW variation in the western and eastern parts of northern China, as well as a change in summer PW patterns which has been occurring since the mid‐1990s or the beginning of the 2000s. These findings mostly agree with Xie et al . [ ]. However, the results of this research indicate that northeastern China has experienced a decreasing trend in summer PW, especially after the mid‐1990s, which is in disagreement with previous work [ Xie et al ., ; Zhai and Eskridge , ] due to the different periods considered. The northeastern region of China is mainly located north of 40°N and east of 115°E, and its moisture is controlled mostly by the East Asian summer monsoon. According to Zou et al . [ ] and Piao et al . [ ], the observations could be explained by the decreased EASM, warming, and droughts in recent decades. Besides, several studies did show a decline in moisture over the Tibet Autonomous Region [ Xie et al ., ; Wang and Guo , ], but this was not always found to be the case in the present research, whether using reanalysis data or radiosonde measurements (Figures b and c), and it is still unclear how this phenomenon is related to changes in surface vegetation. Therefore, PW variation is most likely different from west to east within northern China because of natural conditions. In addition, PW is notably more influenced by other factors in the western arid/semi‐arid regions of northern China. PW Links to Changes in NDVI Over Northern China To examine the links between PW and NDVI over northern China, the linear trend of maximum summer NDVI at the national scale from 1982 to 2008, as shown in Figure a, was examined. It shows strong spatial heterogeneity, but the great contrast between northern China (delineated by the black line) and southern China is very clear. Most of central and southern China showed a decreasing trend in summer NDVI, while northern China and most of its northwestern part had an increased NDVI from 1982 to 2008. Overall, an increased NDVI was found in 40.30% (90% significant increase in 18.45% of the pixels) of China's land area in the summer. This result is also consistent with those reported by Peng et al . [ ]. Both Figures b and a indicate that most regions of northern China, mainly in its central and western part, became greener and moister in summer from 1982 to 2008. Furthermore, a linear Pearson's correlation result between summer NDVI and PW over northern China from 1982 to 2008 is shown in Figure b. This result presents a positive relation, mostly in the western and central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which suggests that increased PW in these regions can possibly be attributed to increased summer NDVI. Although Figure b reveals a strong link between NDVI and PW in the study region, it does not take the TPs of the two variables into account. However, previous studies have explored and identified the TPs of vegetation changes. For example, Park and Sohn [ ] noted that a TP in vegetation variation observed in the mid‐1990s existed in mid‐high latitudes over the northern hemisphere from 1982 to 2006, and Peng et al . [ ] found that the change occurred around the 2000s in northern China in the growing season. Meanwhile, EOF modes 2 and 3 of the PW, as described in , also suggest that a TP appeared in the summer PW over northern China around the mid‐1990s. Therefore, if a coupling between PW and NDVI does exist, the geographical distribution of the TPs in the summer trends of the two variables should be similar. To determine whether this is true, a piecewise linear regression approach was used to identify the TPs of the summer PW and NDVI trends, with the results shown in Figures a and b, respectively. The spatial distributions of the trends in summer PW and NDVI before and after the PW TPs are displayed in Figures c–f. The significance level of the TPs in Figures a and b are both greater than 90%. Figure a shows that the TPs of summer PW occurred mostly in the northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the central Tibet Autonomous Region around the 2000s, which is most consistent with the TP distribution of summer NDVI in these areas (red box) as shown in Figure b. Figures c and e show the spatial distributions of the trend in summer PW before and after its TP. Clearly opposite trends can be observed when comparing these two plots. Before the PW TP, 94.27% of the pixels with significant TPs show an increasing trend in summer PW, which suggests a more humid climate in the western area over northern China. However, after the TP, the climate becomes more and more dry. At the same time, the trends in summer NDVI in these two hot spot regions (northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and central Tibet Autonomous Region) are consistent with PW; NDVI shows similar trends to PW, which again suggests that increased (decreased) vegetation may be attributed to a wetter (drier) climate in northwestern China. Overall, the analytical results demonstrate that the central and western parts of northern China are the most sensitive region for interaction between NDVI and PW, while PW in the northeastern region is influenced more by atmospheric circulations. Effects of NDVI on PW According to the analysis described above, NDVI changes are highly correlated with changes in PW in northern China in the summer, especially over the central and western arid/semi‐arid regions. The actual effect of vegetation changes on regional PW cannot be assessed without excluding the influences of atmospheric circulations. The impacts of major atmospheric circulations such as EASM, SASM, and WI, as mentioned in , are discussed below. By building two scenarios and using the optimal stepwise linear regression method, as well as taking into account the TPs of the PW, the standardized coefficient e in equation has been estimated pixel by pixel over northern China, with result shown in Figure . It is obvious that e is positive in most regions of northern China, particularly in the central and western water‐limited areas, and negative in the three provinces of northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning), south of the central provinces, and in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region. This result matches previous findings by the authors, and its pattern is similar to that shown in Figure b. This finding indicates that increased vegetation greenness in most northern nonmonsoon regions, as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region, is a possible reason for the observed increases in atmospheric water content, which has important implications for water cycle in this area, especially in arid/semi‐arid regions. After testing the significance of the e values using the F‐test , the pixels with a significance level greater than 90% were selected and are shown in Figure a. The corresponding variances in PW explained by the NDVI of these pixels, which are measured in terms of the difference between the square of the correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of the two scenarios, are shown in Figure b. Overall, there are four major regions where NDVI has positive influence on PW over northern China (indicated by red boxes in Figure a): the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (box 1), the northern of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (box 2), the Eastern Qinghai Province (box 3), and the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region (box 4). Figure b shows that almost all the R 2 values increased in the four regions, with the largest increase being as much as 30%, indicating that summer vegetation greenness in the four regions is very closely linked to PW and accounts for as much as 30% of the total PW variance from1982 to 2008. It is very interesting to note that all these regions are mountainous: the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is south of the Yin Mountains, the northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is north of the Tianshan Mountain area, the eastern part of Qinghai Province is located in the eastern Qilian Mountains, and the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region is part of the Himalayas. Due to their special topography and geolocation, these four regions have relatively abundant available water for vegetation, even for forest. Moreover, the first region (box 1) is within the ecological transitional zone, which is the most sensitive region for the vegetation‐climate interaction over northern China [ Dessler et al ., ]. Note that summer vegetation increased markedly in these regions during the study period, as shown in Figure a. The significantly negatively influenced regions, by contrast, are scarce and scattered. The vegetation activity in these regions makes little contribution to the variation of local PW, except for some forest areas in southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region. The ET process is a possible physical mechanism for the positive impact of vegetation changes on PW. Vegetation transpiration transfers water vapor into the atmosphere, meaning that increased vegetation greenness may contribute to the regional availability of atmospheric moisture vapor, in particular in arid and semi‐arid regions, where the hydro‐climate is closely linked to local moisture recycling, which is strongly affected by local vegetation greenness [ Makarieva et al ., ; Wang and Dickinson , ; Wu et al ., ]. Moreover, Ellison et al . [ ] assumed that forest‐driven ET process also contributes to the atmospheric moisture vapor cross‐continental transport and intensifies the regional water cycle, though Makarieva and Gorshkov [ ] claimed that this “biotic pump” could be created only by the intact contiguous cover of natural forest from the coastal regions. To verify their points, the correlation between summer season ET and PW over northern China was examined, with results shown in Figure a. Here only the period from 1983 to 2006 was analyzed because the ET data set was the only available data set. It is obvious that ET is generally positively correlated with PW, and most of the significant areas are located in the four regions shown in Figure a.This demonstrates that, on one hand, strengthened ET driven by increased vegetation greenness is one of the major sources for water vapor in the atmosphere, and on the other hand, the fact that ET is not strongly related to PW in some areas of the four hot spot regions (i.e., gray areas in box 1) demonstrates that increased forest cover over the four regions could help transport additional PW from regions with a surplus to other regions that lack adequate moisture availability. However, in regions where PW is controlled mostly by monsoons, such as the northeast, the effect of vegetation on PW is minor, although forest cover has increased markedly. It is also noteworthy that vegetation greenness in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region is negatively correlated with regional water vapor and that vegetation here decreased during the study period (Figure a). According to Zhang et al . [ ], the increased vegetation greenness in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region is influencing the Bowen ratio, which tends to enhance vertical ascending motion and forces more atmospheric moisture to precipitate out. Wang et al . [ ] also pointed out that the precipitable‐water conversion rates over southeastern Tibet decreased from 1970 to 2009, which is a possible reason that PW has increased. This may explain the decreased vegetation greenness accompanied by increased atmospheric water vapor in the southeastern Tibet Autonomous region. In addition, the thermal effect, which refers mainly to the alteration of air temperature due to change in the solar energy absorption and energy partitioning into latent and sensible fluxes accompanied by changes in vegetation and water vapor, also influences the PW by altering ET process and the water‐vapor holding capacity. The results shown in Figures a and b have verified our hypothesis that ET driven by increased vegetation greenness makes a major contribution to increased atmospheric water vapor in water‐shortage‐afflicted northwestern China. Nevertheless, the opposite hypothesis that increased PW causes increased NDVI through increased precipitation might still be proposed. It is worth noting that the precipitation that occurs barely satisfies the needs for vegetation growth in the arid/semi‐arid areas of northwestern China, even in the summer season in which most precipitation occurs. If this is the case, then the spatial pattern of the correlation between precipitation and PW should be similar to that between ET and PW. Further examination reveals that the correlation between precipitation and PW (see Figure c) does not exhibit patterns similar to Figure b and the relation is especially poor for the four hot regions. This helps to demonstrate that increased vegetation greenness in the summer would increase local water vapor within the nonmonsoon‐impacted, water‐shortage‐afflicted northwestern China region. Moreover, this conclusion is also supported by some numerical simulation studies [ Liu et al ., , ]. Summary and Discussions Water vapor is an important greenhouse gas that accounts for 50% to 75% of the greenhouse effect today [ Ravishankara , ] and is a key driver of many atmospheric processes. Although the positive trend in the summer PW over China, especially in northern China, has been documented by many previous studies [ Li et al ., ; Xie et al ., ; Zhai and Eskridge , ], this study has demonstrated that this trend can be largely attributed to increased vegetation greenness through ET after several ecosystem restoration projects have been implemented during the last three decades over northern China. This study began by examining the spatiotemporal variations of PW and vegetation and then established the relationship between changes in PW and vegetation changes in the summer (June‐August) over northern China using seasonal mean PW and maximum NDVI data for the period from 1982 to 2008. Finally, the effect of vegetation changes on local PW were identified and quantified by excluding the influences of major atmospheric circulations. An analysis of PW and NDVI data sets confirmed the general positive trends and the strong spatiotemporal coupling variations of these two variables in the summer over most of northern China, especially in its central and western parts. After removing the influences of atmospheric circulation indices (EASMI, SASMI, WI), the increases in NDVI were found to be partly responsible for increased atmospheric water‐vapor content over most parts of northern China, in particular the nonmonsoon interior water‐limited regions. This finding is consistent with those of Wu et al . [2012] for the Tarim River Basin. Further analyses were conducted to identify the most sensitive regions for vegetation‐PW interaction, and four regions where NDVI had significant positive impact on PW were identified. In these regions, NDVI can account for as much as 30% of the variance in PW. To explore how increased vegetation greenness strengthens PW in the four regions, the relation between ET and NDVI and, between ET and PW from 1983 to 2006 and the correlation between precipitation and PW from 1982 to 2008 were investigated in the four regions. All the results suggested that (1) ET controlled by terrestrial vegetation is one of the major sources of regional atmospheric water vapor in interior regions far from oceans, and (2) in mountainous areas, mainly covered by forest due to the adequate water supply, the local moisture cycle is intensified and reinforced because of the ecological functions of forest besides ET. Based on this evidence, it can be concluded that vegetation is very important to the moisture cycle in arid/semi‐arid regions over northern China. In regions where water is amply sufficient for vegetation, the presence of forest can have more influence on moisture cycling. These findings have great implications for assessments of the greenhouse effect and water‐resources management in water‐limited regions. However, other factors, such as changes in glacial extent, irrigation, and drought over northern China, need to be further explored. The nonlinear relation between vegetation and PW also needs to be explored in a subsequent study.

Satellite‐based measurements of temperature and long‐lived constituents [e.g., Wu et al. , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Garcia et al. , ; Tunbridge et al. , ], in combination with satellite‐based wind observations [ Wu et al. , ; Lieberman , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Gu et al. , ], have shown that Q2DW amplitudes peak in the extratropical MLT during both Southern Hemisphere (SH) and Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer shortly after solstice. As an example, Figure plots temperature and meridional wind anomalies at 40°N and 0.02 hPa (~75 km) during July 2009 showing longitude‐time behavior consistent with a westward propagating Q2DW. The Q2DW originates primarily from baroclinically unstable regions near the summertime mesospheric easterly jet. Current theory indicates that these regions produce fast‐growing instabilities that can project onto the zonal wave number 3 global Rossby‐gravity mode [ Salby , ; Plumb , ; Pfister , ; Lieberman , ; Rojas and Norton , ]. One key aspect of the Q2DW that is not yet well understood is the cause of its intermittency, i.e., it is often observed in “bursts” throughout the summer season (see, e.g., 1–10 July and 20–25 July in Figure ). As a result, the observed Q2DW can exhibit a high degree of both intraseasonal and interannual variability that has been extensively documented in both ground‐based and satellite‐based data sets [e.g., Wu et al. , ; Limpasuvan and Wu , ; Garcia et al. , ; Tunbridge et al. , ; Offermann et al. , ]. Modeling studies suggest that this variability can have a wide‐ranging effect on, e.g., summer polar mesopause temperatures [ Pendlebury , ], thermospheric neutral winds [ Chang et al. , ], and ionospheric electron content [ Yue et al. , ]. Investigating the origins of Q2DW variability can therefore improve our overall understanding of MLT dynamics. Conditions for baroclinic instability are extremely sensitive to gradients in background zonal wind and temperature, which in the MLT arise through complex interactions involving gravity wave drag and solar tides. Norton and Thuburn [ ] used a global circulation model (GCM) to demonstrate that the effect of gravity wave drag maintains the meridional and vertical gradients in the summertime MLT zonal wind distribution that are necessary for the growth of baroclinically unstable local modes. More recently, Ern et al. [ ] found observational evidence that enhanced gravity wave drag can trigger Q2DW activity by decelerating the summertime mesospheric easterly jet. Salby and Callaghan [ ] showed that the presence of the migrating diurnal solar tide in a primitive equation model can increase the damping of the Q2DW and thus limit its growth under solstice conditions through nonlinear wave‐wave interactions. Nonlinear interactions between the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide can also cause a rapid growth in Q2DW amplitude and a contemporaneous (albeit smaller) reduction in the diurnal tidal amplitude. This process was first noted in the observational study by Teitelbaum and Vial [ ], and later described in several modeling studies [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Salby and Callaghan , ; Chang et al. , ]. Key factors determining whether or not this rapid amplification of the Q2DW will occur are a strong easterly jet in the summer upper mesosphere and phase locking of the Q2DW with the diurnal cycle (i.e., a 48 h period) [ Walterscheid and Vincent , ]. These conditions, and subsequent Q2DW‐tide interactions, have been observed in the SH summer MLT [ Hecht et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ], but it is not clear whether or not such processes also contribute to variability in the Q2DW during NH summer. Here we examine the roles of both baroclinic instability mechanisms and possible Q2DW‐tidal interactions in controlling Q2DW intermittency in the NH summer extratropical MLT. Doing so requires a data set of global winds and temperatures extending throughout the MLT region with sufficient temporal resolution to separate the Q2DW and tidal signatures. Presently, such information cannot be obtained from a single set of observations, but can instead be obtained by combining multiple sets of MLT observations using a high‐altitude data assimilation system (HDAS). This study examines Q2DW and tidal variability using 6‐hourly synoptic meteorological analyses of winds and temperature from the surface to 90 km altitude over the June–August periods of 2007–2009 produced by the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System with Advanced Level Physics‐High Altitude (NOGAPS‐ALPHA). The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS has been used previously to describe Q2DW variability in the SH extratropics during January [ McCormack et al. , ], and to provide evidence of nonlinear Q2DW‐tidal interactions in the extratropical SH summer MLT region [ McCormack et al. , ]. This is the first study using HDAS fields to examine the behavior of the Q2DW and tides in the NH summer. Although the amplitude of the Q2DW in the NH is smaller than its SH counterpart, it has a more complex spatial structure consisting of zonal wave numbers 2–4 whose relative amplitudes vary over the course of the season [ Tunbridge et al. , ]. We employ space‐time spectral analysis of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields to discriminate among the different spatiotemporal components of the Q2DW and the diurnal tide, which is not possible using ground‐based data sets or asynoptic satellite records alone, given their limitations in spatial and temporal coverage. This information is used to characterize the intraseasonal and interannual variability in the NH Q2DW in relation to the migrating diurnal tide. NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds are also used as input for a linear instability model to diagnose the origin and growth of the Q2DW throughout the NH summer via baroclinic instability. The results of this investigation indicate that the strength and location of the midlatitude mesospheric easterly jet core is the main factor controlling the behavior of the Q2DW during NH summer. The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS system and data analysis techniques are described in . presents the intraseasonal and interannual variability in the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide during NH summer of 2007–2009. discusses the origin and propagation of the Q2DW using diagnostic wave activity calculations. presents results from a linear instability model that uses NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilated winds to examine how the Q2DW arises from baroclinically unstable regions near the summer easterly jet. contains a summary of these results and discusses future research directions. Data and Methodology The NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS assimilates operational meteorological observations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere in combination with research satellite observations of middle atmospheric temperature, ozone, and water vapor to provide a comprehensive analysis of atmospheric state variables from the surface to ~90 km. In this section, we first present a brief overview of the HDAS system. For a complete description of the production version of NOGAPS‐ALPHA, see Eckermann et al. [ ]. We then discuss the methods used to analyze the behavior of the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide in the NH summer MLT. NOGAPS‐ALPHA Description NOGAPS‐ALPHA is built upon the framework of the NOGAPS numerical weather prediction and analysis system that originally extended from the surface to 1 hPa (~50 km). It consists of two main components: a global spectral forecast model [ Hogan and Rosmond , ], and a three‐dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation algorithm [ Daley and Barker , ]. To expand this system's meteorological analysis capability through the middle atmosphere, the vertical domain of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA forecast model was raised to ~100 km [ Hoppel et al. , ], and a 68‐level (L68) hybrid σ − p vertical coordinate was introduced [ Eckermann , ], giving ~2 km spacing of levels throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere. In the present study, the forecast model component of NOGAPS‐ALPHA uses a T79 horizontal wave number truncation to give an effective horizontal grid spacing of 1.5° in longitude and latitude on a quadratic Gaussian grid. Extending NOGAPS‐ALPHA into the middle atmosphere required the addition of several new physics packages, as described in Eckermann et al. [ ]. These include improved shortwave heating and longwave cooling rates [ Chou et al. , ; Chou and Suarez , ], updated parameterizations of subgrid scale orographic [ Palmer et al. , ] and nonorographic gravity wave drag [ Eckermann , ], and linearized photochemical parameterizations for middle atmospheric ozone and water vapor [ McCormack et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ], which are both prognostic model variables in NOGAPS‐ALPHA. The data assimilation component of NOGAPS‐ALPHA is based on the NRL Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System [ Daley and Barker , ], a 3DVAR system with a 6 h update cycle that assimilates both conventional ground‐based observations (e.g., wind, pressure, and temperature from station reports and radiosondes) and operational satellite‐based observations (e.g., microwave radiances, surface winds, and precipitable water). In addition, NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilates Aura MLS Version 2.2 temperature, O 3 , and H 2 O profile measurements [ Hoppel et al. , ]. The Aura satellite completes ~13 orbits per day with coverage between 82°S and 82°N latitude. NOGAPS‐ALPHA also assimilates Version 1.07 temperature profile measurements from the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Radiometry (SABER) instrument, which is a side‐viewing instrument whose latitude coverage alternates every 2 months to view high latitudes in both hemispheres. During NH summer, in mid‐July, SABER switches from its north viewing mode (latitude range of 83°N to 52°S) to south viewing mode (52°N to 83°S). This change in coverage is not seen to affect the assimilated Q2DW in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses, which is generally largest equatorward of 50°N. The bulk of the information on the Q2DW and tides in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses comes from MLS and SABER temperature profiles that are assimilated between the 32 and 0.002 hPa pressure levels. The vertical resolution of the SABER temperature retrieval remains ~2 km throughout the stratosphere and mesosphere while the resolution of the MLS temperature retrieval degrades from ~3 km in the stratosphere to ~13 km near the 0.01 hPa level. Global mean systematic biases of 2–3 K between the MLS and SABER temperatures have been removed prior to assimilation to avoid introducing spurious spatial variability into the temperature analyses, as described in the work of Hoppel et al. [ ]. To obtain accurate heating and cooling rates in the middle atmosphere, NOGAPS‐ALPHA also assimilates daily MLS H 2 O and O 3 profiles between 220–0.002 hPa and 215–0.02 hPa, respectively [ Eckermann et al. , ]. To investigate the Q2DW in the NH MLT, the present study analyzes global synoptic zonal and meridional wind fields produced by the NOGAPS‐ALPHA HDAS. NOGAPS‐ALPHA does not directly assimilate middle atmospheric wind measurements; instead, it uses a formulation of the gradient wind approximation in the off‐diagonal elements of the observation error covariance matrix to produce balanced wind and temperature increments. These increments are integrated forward in time by the forecast model component, and the resulting middle atmospheric wind fields are further constrained by the physical parameterizations in the model (e.g., gravity wave drag, diffusion, etc.). As previous studies have shown [ McCormack et al. , , ] the resulting 6‐hourly global wind and temperature fields have the spatial and temporal resolutions necessary to discriminate between the Q2DW and diurnal tide in the SH summer MLT; the present study extends these investigations to the NH summer. A critical test of any assimilation system is verification with independent observations. For middle atmospheric winds and temperatures, these types of observations consist mainly of ground‐based radar and lidar measurements over a relatively small number of locations. Eckermann et al. [ ] and Stevens et al. [ ] showed that diurnal and semidiurnal variations in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT wind and temperature fields agree well with independent ground‐based observations at high northern latitudes during the 2007 summer season. McCormack et al. [ ] also showed good agreement between the Q2DW in NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT winds and medium‐frequency radar winds over Adelaide during January 2006 and January 2008. Furthermore, NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds compared well with Tromsø meteor radar winds at 70°N during January 2009 [ Coy et al. , ]. To demonstrate that NOGAPS‐ALPHA MLT winds used in the present study can capture the day‐to‐day variability in the Q2DW seen in ground‐based data sets during NH summer, Figure compares meridional winds at 88 km altitude from meteor radar observations [ Singer et al. , ] over Kühlungsborn (54°N, 12°E) with corresponding NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds at 0.0036 hPa during July and August 2007. To facilitate the comparison, a five‐point smoothing was applied to the hourly meteor wind values in order to reduce high‐frequency variability. As Figure shows, there is good overall agreement between the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyzed winds and the meteor radar winds at this location. Specifically, both data sets exhibit 2 day periodicities during days 195–203 with similar amplitude and phase. This agreement is notable given the fact that no wind information is directly assimilated by NOGAPS‐ALPHA, as discussed in . There are also times during July–August 2007 when significant differences occur between the NOGAPS‐ALPHA and meteor radar winds, e.g., on days 205–206, which may be due to gravity wave activity at small scales which cannot be resolved by the assimilation system. Although additional comparisons are desirable to fully verify the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses, results to date clearly demonstrate that the 6‐hourly analyzed winds can capture key features of the Q2DW. Space‐Time Spectral Analysis To describe the characteristics of the Q2DW and diurnal migrating tide, we use a two‐dimensional fast Fourier transform (2DFFT) approach following Hayashi [ ], where NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields at a given latitude and pressure level are expanded as Fourier series in longitude and time. Following the procedure described in McCormack et al. [ ], daily zonal means are subtracted from each 6‐hourly longitude‐time field and then a cosine taper is applied to the first and last 10% of each record in time. The resulting space‐time power spectrum describes the amount of variance at each frequency and zonal wave number. The 2DFFT is applied over a 32 day interval to derive results for an individual month. It is also applied over a 75 day interval to obtain results over the summer period from early June to early August. Figure plots the resulting normalized power spectra derived for a 32 day period (128 points) of 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields from 30 June to 31 July 2009 at 0.02 hPa (~75 km) and 40°N (see Figure ). The 2DFFT method can identify both westward and eastward propagating features that are associated, by convention, with positive and negative frequency values, respectively. At this particular level, only westward features are found and so only positive frequencies are plotted. The results of the 2DFFT in Figure show that most of the variance in the NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields at this location is found in westward propagating zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 with frequencies between 0.45 and 0.60 cpd. By examining 2DFFT spectra from all NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and wind fields over the NH from 1 to 0.002 hPa during July of 2007–2009, we find that power at zonal wave 3 consistently peaks in the frequency range 0.4–0.53 cpd, while power at zonal wave 4 consistently peaks between 0.5 and 0.625 cpd. This combination of waves 3 and 4 at periods near 2 days in Figure agrees with the study of MLS temperatures by Tunbridge et al. [ ], who found the Q2DW during July 2009 to consist primarily of westward zonal wave numbers 3 and 4. In this particular case, we do not find a westward wave 2 component in the power spectra plotted in Figure at 0.02 hPa and 40°N. However, our analysis does find a relatively weak wave 2 component in both wind and temperature at altitudes above 80 km, which is discussed further in . Figure b also indicates variance in the meridional wind field at wave 1 centered on 1 cpd associated with the migrating diurnal tide. A corresponding [1,1] feature is not seen in the temperature power spectra (Figure a) for this particular location. This is due to the latitude structure of the temperature tide in the upper mesosphere, which peaks near the equator and falls off more rapidly with latitude than the meridional wind tide. (The altitude and latitude structure of the tidal response in temperature and meridional wind derived from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA analyses is discussed in more detail in .) It should be noted that although spectral analysis of the 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA output can resolve frequencies down to 2 cpd, the 3DVAR system's ±3 h assimilation window may not be able to fully capture this high‐frequency variability associated with, e.g., the semidiurnal tide. Therefore, this study focuses on possible interactions between the Q2DW and diurnal tide. To study the behavior of the Q2DW and diurnal tide throughout the NH summer season, 6‐hourly longitude/time fields of the individual Q2DW and tide components in the wind and temperature fields are reconstructed by applying appropriate band‐pass filters to the inverse 2DFFT. Based on the analysis of the 2DFFT power spectra described above, pass bands from 0.4–0.53 cpd to 0.5–0.625 cpd are used to isolate the westward propagating zonal wave 3 and 4 components of the Q2DW, respectively. A pass band at zonal wave number 1 from 0.9 to 1.1 cpd is used for the diurnal tide. The root‐mean‐square (RMS) amplitudes of the zonal wave number 1, 3, and 4 components are then calculated from the filtered fields at each latitude and pressure for every time step. Eddy heat and momentum fluxes are also calculated from these filtered fields, and are then used to formulate Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux diagnostics of wave activity associated with the Q2DW. This technique has been applied previously to NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields to investigate the evolution of the Q2DW and diurnal tide in the SH summer mesosphere [ McCormack et al. , , ]. In the present study, we extend this analysis to focus on the NH summers of 2007–2009. 2DFFT Results This section presents detailed information on the latitude and altitude structure of the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide during NH summer obtained from the 2DFFT analysis of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperature and meridional wind fields. This section also discusses both the interannual and intraseasonal variability of these features during June–August of 2007–2009. Interannual Variability of the Q2DW and Diurnal Tide Figure plots mean values of the RMS amplitude for the westward propagating zonal wave number 3 component of the Q2DW in both temperature and meridional wind (referred to in terms of its primary frequency and wave number as [0.5,3]) for the June‐July‐August (JJA) period of 2007–2009. In all three years, the spatial structure of the temperature Q2DW between 70 and 90 km is generally consistent with earlier observations of the NH summer [e.g., Tunbridge et al. , , Figure ]. Specifically, we find that the feature exhibits deep vertical extent throughout the mesosphere between 20°N and 55°N with a maximum in temperature near 40°N and 0.02 hPa (~75 km). Figure also shows that the peak JJA mean temperature amplitudes in this region vary from year to year, reaching 2.2 K in 2007, 2.7 K in 2008, and 3.0 K in 2009. An analysis of the Q2DW by Gu et al. [ ] also found similar interannual variations, i.e., higher Q2DW amplitudes during NH summer 2009 compared to 2007 and 2008. Another maximum in [0.5,3] temperature amplitude is noted in all three years between 50°N and 60°N above 0.002 hPa (~90 km), reaching 2.0 K, 3.3 K, and 3.1 K in 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively (Figures a, c, and e). While this feature appears to be related to the maximum in the [0.5,3] meridional wind component near 95 km (Figures b, d, and f), it should be regarded with some caution as it lies above the top pressure level of 0.002 hPa where MLS and SABER temperature observations are assimilated. For the purposes of this study, we limit discussion of the Q2DW to the altitude region below the 0.002 hPa level (~90 km), where NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields are constrained by observations. The interannual variability in JJA mean meridional wind [0.5,3] amplitudes shown in Figure matches that of the JJA mean temperature amplitudes. For the 3 years analyzed, the Q2DW in meridional wind is strongest in 2009 and weakest in 2007. The spatial structure of the meridional wind [0.5,3] component is consistent from year to year, exhibiting a poleward tilt with increasing height and a maximum at 90 km between 40°N and 50°N. These features are in good qualitative agreement with model simulations of the [0.5,3] feature in meridional wind [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Salby and Callaghan , ; Chang et al. , ], lending confidence in the fidelity of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional wind analyses. A comparison of the spatial structure of the JJA mean [0.5,3] temperature and meridional wind components in Figure shows that the Q2DW in meridional wind does not exhibit the two distinct peaks near 75 km and 90 km seen in the temperature Q2DW. Instead, the amplitude of the meridional wind Q2DW increases steadily with altitude and peaks at 90 km. The spatial structure of the meridional wind Q2DW in Figure is consistent with the interpretation of the Q2DW as a global normal mode, which grows with altitude as atmospheric density decreases until vertical propagation is limited by, e.g., the presence of a critical line where the background wind speed equals the phase speed of the wave. The Q2DW in temperature arises from meridional parcel displacements superimposed upon a background meridional gradient in zonal mean temperature, and the double peak in the temperature Q2DW is produced by the vertical structure in this background temperature gradient throughout the NH summer MLT region. Specifically, maxima in the [0.5,3] temperature amplitude near 0.02 hPa and 0.001 hPa in Figure occur where the meridional gradients in zonal mean temperature are most pronounced; the minimum in the Q2DW temperature amplitude between 0.01 and 0.002 hPa occurs where the meridional temperature gradient is relatively weak. Figure plots the JJA mean amplitudes of the [0.5,4] component in NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperatures and meridional winds. While the latitude and altitude dependences of the [0.5,4] temperature component are similar to the [0.5,3] component, we find that the peak values of [0.5,4] in temperature are located on average ~5° equatorward and ~10–12 km lower than the location of the [0.5,3] temperature peaks. Peak values of the [0.5,4] meridional wind response are also shifted equatorward by ~5°, on average, relative to the peak [0.5,3] wind values. One main difference between the zonal wave number 3 and 4 features, however, is that the [0.5,4] meridional wind amplitudes do not exhibit the sharp increase with height seen in the [0.5,3] wind amplitudes. Another important difference is that, on average, both the peak temperature and wind amplitudes of [0.5,4] are 30% less than the amplitudes of [0.5,3]. We note here that Tunbridge et al. [ ] found evidence for a westward zonal wave number 2 feature associated with the Q2DW in NH summer based on analysis of MLS temperatures from 2004 to 2009. Our 2DFFT analysis of NOGAPS‐ALPHA temperatures finds that peak amplitudes for this [0.5,2] component are typically less than 1.5 K and, unlike the zonal wave 3 and 4 cases, are found over a broad latitude region from 10°N to 70°N above ~80km. The latitude and altitude dependences of the [0.5,2] component in meridional wind (not shown) are also markedly different from the zonal wave number 3 and 4 cases, showing peak values of ~10 m s −1 throughout the upper mesosphere centered over the equator. Because this apparent wave number 2 Q2DW exhibits spatial characteristics that are fundamentally different from [0.5,3] to [0.5,4] results, the present study will focus on the dynamical factors controlling the growth and evolution of wave number 3 and 4 components of the Q2DW in NH summer. Possible relationships between these components and the zonal wave number 2 Q2DW will be examined in a future study. One distinct advantage of 6‐hourly global HDAS output is the ability to discriminate among the diurnal migrating (or [1,1]) tide and the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW. As discussed in , there is both theoretical and observational evidence of mutual interaction between the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide. Most of these studies, however, focus on the SH summer period when Q2DW amplitudes are larger than during NH summer. We next examine the general characteristics of the [1,1] tide obtained from the 2DFFT analysis for June–August of 2007–2009. Figure plots the mean [1,1] RMS amplitudes in both temperature and meridional wind for JJA 2007–2009. The latitude and altitude structure of the tidal amplitudes derived from NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields are quite similar from year to year, and are in good agreement with earlier modeling studies [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Chang et al. , ]. At 0.02 hPa and 40°N, where the [0.5,3] temperature amplitudes are large (as indicated by the symbols in Figure b, d, and f), the JJA mean [1,1] amplitudes in meridional wind are greater in 2007 than in either 2008 or 2009. The larger [1,1] meridional wind amplitudes in JJA 2007 at this location coincide with relatively smaller Q2DW amplitudes observed during JJA 2007. As noted in , larger amplitudes of the migrating diurnal tide can limit the growth of the Q2DW. The interannual variations in tidal amplitudes seen in Figure can be caused by a variety of different factors, including variations in the strength of tidal forcing (i.e., latent heat release and ozone heating), and variations in the strength of the zonal winds in MLT. The latter is highly dependent on gravity wave drag, and wind variations in the stratosphere can act as a filter for upward propagating gravity waves. An analysis of TIMED Doppler Interferometer winds from 2002 to 2007 by Wu et al. [ ] found that amplitudes of the migrating diurnal tide tend to be larger during the westerly phase of the stratospheric quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO). We note that the QBO was in its easterly phase during July 2007; during July 2008 and 2009, winds in the equatorial lower stratosphere were westerly. Therefore, it does not appear that the QBO can explain the interannual variations in the Northern subtropical tidal amplitudes shown in Figure . Although the origins of the interannual variability in the diurnal tide are currently not understood, the JJA mean Q2DW amplitudes and diurnal tide in Figures are consistent with the interpretation that larger tidal amplitudes can limit the growth of the Q2DW. We examine the relationship between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide in more detail in . Intraseasonal Variability of the Q2DW We next examine the variability of the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components over the course of each summer period (June–August). As described in , this is done by applying a band‐pass filter at zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 to the inverse 2‐D Fourier transform of the NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields over a 75 day interval from 5 June to 20 August of each year. To facilitate comparisons with Q2DW variability seen in the SH summer reported by McCormack et al. [ ], we will focus on the seasonal evolution of the Q2DW during NH summer in NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional wind fields. We note that the time behavior of both the Q2DW and diurnal tide in temperature during NH summer (not shown) closely matches the time behavior of these features in meridional wind. Figure plots [0.5,3] amplitudes in meridional wind at 0.02 hPa (~ 75 km) as a function of latitude and time throughout the NH summers of 2007–2009. In all three cases, the [0.5,3] amplitudes peak shortly after solstice and then again 15–20 days later. There is also evidence of a weaker third peak in August. Our analysis of the three JJA periods finds the largest [0.5,3] amplitude of 17 m s −1 occurs during 2009, which is consistent with the larger mean JJA amplitudes in both temperature and pressure during 2009 in Figure . Figure plots the [0.5,4] meridional wind amplitude at 0.02 hPa for the NH summers of 2007–2009. The time behavior of the wave number 4 Q2DW differs from the behavior of wave number 3 in that there are several peaks in amplitude throughout the summer period from late June to mid‐August. For example, [0.5,4] wind amplitudes of 12 m s −1 occur in August of 2007 and 2009, while in 2008 the maximum amplitude of 15 m s −1 occurs in mid‐July. As with the [0.5,3] amplitudes in Figure , the largest [0.5,4] amplitudes at this level also occur during JJA 2009. Overall, the meridional extent of the peak [0.5,4] amplitudes for all three summers at this level is narrower in latitude than for the [0.5,3] amplitudes in Figure . The two peaks in the [0.5,3] amplitudes following solstice are consistent with the results in Tunbridge et al. [ , Figure c]. This is to be expected, since NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilates the same MLS temperature observations (in addition to SABER temperature observations). Offermann et al. [ ] found similar behavior of the Q2DW from upper mesospheric OH temperature measurements at 51°N during 2004–2009, i.e., two peaks in Q2DW amplitude in early and late NH summer, although this study was not able to distinguish among different wave number components of the Q2DW. Offermann et al. [ ] also reported a peak in Q2DW temperature amplitudes in April, giving rise to an apparent triple‐peak structure throughout the NH spring‐summer period. Presently, NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields for NH spring are only available for the years 2008 and 2009. Our analysis of temperature and horizontal winds does not find evidence for Q2DW activity during April or May of 2008 and 2009. The study by Tunbridge et al. [ ] also found no significant Q2DW signal in MLS temperatures at 91 km during spring of 2008 and 2009 [ Tunbridge et al. , , Figure ]; however, Tunbridge et al. [ ] did report Q2DW temperature amplitudes of 2–3 K in spring of 2006. Since the study by Offermann et al. [ ] reports Q2DW amplitudes averaged over several years (e.g., 2005–2009), it is not possible to evaluate this apparent interannual variability in the NH spring Q2DW from their OH temperature measurements. Future studies that involve direct comparisons between NOGAPS‐ALPHA fields and independent ground‐based observations on a year‐by‐year basis throughout NH spring and summer would clarify this issue. Intraseasonal Variability of the Migrating Diurnal Tide The results in show that over the three NH summers examined, the largest Q2DW amplitudes occur in 2009, when the amplitudes of the diurnal tide are smallest. Earlier observational studies of the Q2DW during SH summer [e.g., Lima et al. , ; Pancheva , ; Hecht et al. , ] found an inverse relationship between the amplitudes of the Q2DW and the migrating diurnal tide. As discussed in , one explanation for this relationship is that larger diurnal tidal amplitudes can locally reinforce the Q2DW, which promotes instability and wave breaking that effectively limit the amplification of the Q2DW. Another explanation is that when Q2DW amplitudes are large, nonlinear interactions can take place between the [0.5,3] and [1,1] “parent” waves that produce “child” waves whose frequency/wave number characteristics are determined from combinations of the sums and differences of the parent waves. In this scenario, the cascade of energy to smaller scales causes the amplitude of the child waves to grow at the expense of the diurnal tide, producing anticorrelation between the Q2DW and diurnal tide shortly after summer solstice. Numerous modeling studies have documented this latter process in both NH and SH summer [ Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; Chang et al. , ], as evidenced by rapid enhancement of the Q2DW along with a simultaneous decrease of ~20% in the amplitude of the diurnal tide and the emergence of spectral peaks in the meridional wind field at harmonics of the diurnal cycle at subtropical latitudes near 90 km. To determine whether the observed interannual variability in the Q2DW over the three NH summers can be attributed to possible Q2DW‐tidal interactions, we now examine the temporal variability of the [1,1] amplitudes in meridional wind in relation to the Q2DW. Figure plots the [1,1] meridional wind amplitude as a function of latitude and time at the 0.02 hPa level (~75 km) for the NH summer period of 2007–2009. The [1,1] signal is largely confined to the subtropical regions of each hemisphere, which is consistent with earlier studies [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Wu et al. , ; Lieberman , ; Chang et al. , ]. In all 3 years, the tidal amplitudes are at a minimum near solstice and tend to increase as the summer progresses. A comparison of Figures and shows that when [0.5,3] amplitudes in meridional wind between 20°N and 40°N were comparatively weak during July 2007 (Figure a), corresponding [1,1] amplitudes were comparatively strong, exceeding 5 m s −1 throughout much of the NH subtropics. The larger [0.5,3] amplitudes in July of 2008 and 2009 (Figures b and c, respectively) occur when tidal amplitudes were comparatively weaker (less than 5 m s −1 ) throughout the NH subtropics. While the results in Figure confirm the inverse relationship between the Q2DW and diurnal tide from 1 year to the next at ~75 km, there is no indication of correlation between the Q2DW and tide within an individual season that would indicate the presence of any type of mutual, nonlinear interaction. As noted above, this process has generally been found to occur at higher altitudes in the subtropical regions where the amplitudes of both the Q2DW and tide are much larger than they are at 75 km. To further investigate the possibility of nonlinear Q2DW‐tide interactions in NH summer, we have compared the intraseasonal variability of the [1,1], [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components in meridional wind over a range of NH latitudes from 0.1 to 0.002 hPa. As an example, Figure plots time series of the [0.5,3], [0.5,4], and [1,1] amplitudes derived from the 2DFFT analysis at 30°N and 0.0036 hPa (~88 km) over the JJA periods of 2007–2009. This level is chosen for the comparison based on the study by McCormack et al. [ ], which found anticorrelation between the [1,1] and [0.5,3] components of NOGAPS‐ALPHA meridional winds in the SH summer at 0.0036 hPa and 30°S latitude and a resulting [1,6] “child‐wave” signature indicative of nonlinear interactions between the diurnal tide and Q2DW. To determine if such behavior is evident in the NH summer MLT region, we focus in particular on the month of July when the [0.5,3] amplitudes are generally largest. As Figure indicates, there is no evidence of a strong anticorrelation between [1,1] and either [0.5,3] or [0.5,4] at this location to indicate that the larger Q2DW amplitudes in 2008 or 2009 result from the Q2DW growing at the expense of the diurnal migrating tide via nonlinear wave‐wave interaction. Similar analysis at other pressure levels and latitudes throughout the NH summer MLT (not shown) confirms this result. We also find no signature of the [1,6] or other child waves in the power spectra of the wind fields that would indicate Q2DW‐tidal interactions. Instead, we find periods of both correlation and anticorrelation between the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, most notably during July of 2007 and 2009, suggesting that in some circumstances conditions may favor growth of both Q2DW modes, while in other circumstances one component of the Q2DW may be growing preferentially over another. Overall, the lack of a strong anticorrelation between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide within the individual seasons (illustrated in Figure ) indicates that year‐to‐year variability in the background state of the NH summertime mesosphere, rather than amplification of the Q2DW due to interaction with the tides, could be responsible for the interannual differences in the amplitudes of the Q2DW seen in Figures and . In the following section, we use the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological analyses to examine how variations in the background state affects the origin and growth of the Q2DW in NH summer. EP‐Flux Diagnostics In this section, we employ a series of diagnostic calculations to examine the origin and growth of the Q2DW in the NH summer based on linear quasi‐geostrophic theory. Such an approach has been used previously to study the behavior of the Q2DW near the stratopause [ Randel , ; Orsolini et al. , ; Limpasuvan et al. , ] and identify regions of baroclinic and/or barotropic instability favoring Q2DW growth and propagation using daily stratospheric meteorological fields. In the present work, we extend this type of analysis into the upper mesosphere using global synoptic NOGAPS‐ALPHA wind and temperature fields. A necessary condition for the growth of the Q2DW in the summer extratropical mesosphere via baroclinic instability is a reversal of the meridional gradient in zonal mean quasi‐geostrophic potential vorticity _placeholder_formula_ [see, e.g., Plumb , ; Pfister , ]. In spherical coordinates this is computed from the relation _placeholder_formula_ where φ is latitude, _placeholder_formula_ is the zonal mean zonal wind speed, H is the scale height, z is the log‐pressure vertical coordinate, N is the Brunt‐Vaisälä frequency, a is the Earth's radius, and Ω is the planetary rotation rate. As equation shows, reversals in _placeholder_formula_ (i.e., from positive to negative values) are determined by the curvature in the background zonal wind distribution. Consequently, accurate wind analyses are needed to diagnose baroclinic instability. Here we use global NOGAPS‐ALPHA horizontal wind and temperature fields on constant pressure surfaces to compute _placeholder_formula_ during July of 2007, 2008, and 2009, when the [0.5,3] amplitudes tend to be largest. This information shows how variations in baroclinic instability from one NH summer to the next may help to explain the observed interannual variations in the Q2DW amplitudes shown in Figures and . While reversal of _placeholder_formula_ is a necessary condition for Q2DW growth through baroclinic instability, it is not sufficient. Conditions must also support the growth of the disturbance in the absence of a critical line. Theory states that growth of the Q2DW is related to EP flux divergence in baroclinically unstable regions [e.g., Plumb , ]. The EP flux vector can be computed from the eddy heat and momentum fluxes associated with the Q2DW using the relation _placeholder_formula_ where ρ is density, f is the Coriolis parameter, and R is the gas constant for dry air. The terms _placeholder_formula_ , and _placeholder_formula_ represent zonal mean eddy momentum and heat fluxes (overbars represent zonal means, primes denote deviations from the zonal mean, and brackets denote a daily average). These quantities are computed from gridded 6‐hourly NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind, meridional wind, and temperature fields that have been band‐pass filtered in order to isolate the [0.5,3] or [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, as described in . Although numerous modeling studies have examined EP flux‐based diagnostics of the Q2DW, only a few studies have used observations to calculate EP fluxes associated with the Q2DW. For example, Lieberman [ ] used High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) wind and temperature observations from January 1994 to compute EP flux divergences in the SH summer mesosphere. The study by Offermann et al. [ ] used geostrophic winds derived from MLS temperature measurements to relate the occurrence of baroclinically unstable conditions to the intraseasonal variability in the Q2DW observed from ground‐based stations in northern Europe. Similarly, Ern et al. [ ] used wind information derived from SABER temperatures to investigate forcing of the Q2DW by gravity wave activity. Here we use output from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA global HDAS to describe EP flux divergence associated with both [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW in the NH summer. Figure plots EP flux vectors related to the [0.5,3] Q2DW for three cases: 20 July 2007 (Figure a), 16 July 2008 (Figure b), and 23 July 2009 (Figure c). These three cases were chosen based on the large Q2DW amplitudes observed on these dates (see Figure ). Also plotted in Figure is the daily average zonal mean zonal wind distribution for these days, from which we calculate values of _placeholder_formula_ . To illustrate the relationship between baroclinically unstable regions and Q2DW growth, shaded regions in Figure indicate where _placeholder_formula_ is negative. In all three cases, Figure shows EP flux divergence related to the [0.5,3] component of the Q2DW near the core of the easterly jet between 0.05 and 0.1 hPa. The direction of the EP flux vectors indicate propagation of wave activity away from the approximate location of the critical line for the [0.5,3] wave, which is indicated by the bold red contour. In the lower mesosphere the propagation is primarily equatorward, while in the upper mesosphere it is primarily poleward and upward. We note that the regions of high vertical EP flux in Figure coincide with the location of the local maxima in the [0.5,3] temperature amplitudes in Figure . This indicates that the temperature Q2DW near ~75 km and 40°N may be triggered by baroclinic instability near the jet core. We explore this possibility further in section with the use of a linear instability model that uses the NOGAPS‐ALPHA assimilated winds and temperatures as input. Figure plots the EP fluxes of the Q2DW for three cases when [0.5,4] amplitudes peaked during the three NH summers: 4 August 2007 (Figure a), 22 June 2008 (Figure b), and 4 July 2009 (Figure c). Wave activity associated with the [0.5,4] component originates just equatorward of the easterly jet core between 0.1 and 0.2 hPa and propagates away from the estimated location of the critical line (blue contour in Figure ), mainly in the upward and poleward direction. It is interesting to note how the locations of the critical lines in Figures and , which are determined by the curvature of the zonal mean zonal wind, can affect the upward propagation of the Q2DW. For example, in the 2007 case (Figure a) the summer easterly jet is weaker and exhibits a poleward tilt with increasing altitude between 40°N and 65°N, which leads to a gradual sloping of the critical lines upward and poleward, away from the source regions. In the 2008 and 2009 cases, the jet is stronger and its core is centered between 40°N and 50°N, producing a “bull‐nose” shape in the location of the critical lines where the equatorward edge of the critical lines extends higher in altitude than in the 2007 case. In particular, the higher extent of the critical lines in the 2009 case (see Figure c and Figure c) appears to direct more Q2DW activity upward into the region above the 0.01 hPa level. To further examine the relationship between the location of the Q2DW critical line and vertical wave propagation during NH summer, Figure plots the time evolution of zonal mean zonal winds over the NH extratropics during July of 2007, 2008, and 2009 at 0.02 hPa. Superimposed upon the wind contours are regions where _placeholder_formula_ is negative (gray shading). Also plotted in Figure are values of the [0.5,3] eddy heat flux (heavy black contours), which are proportional to the vertical component of the EP‐flux (equation ). During July 2007 (Figure a), the location of the [0.5,3] critical line retreats poleward as the month progresses due to the weakening easterly jet. In contrast, the stronger easterly jet during July 2008 and 2009 (Figures b and c) maintains the position of the [0.5,3] critical line near 40°N throughout the month. As a result, there are more sustained periods of high eddy heat flux during July 2008 and 2009. These results indicate that the larger Q2DW amplitudes in July during 2008 and 2009 as compared to July 2007 can be attributed to the characteristics of the summer easterly jet. Specifically, a stronger and more defined jet structure near the Q2DW source region acts to focus more wave activity upward through a smaller area by nature of the critical line's location. A weaker jet, on the other hand, results in the critical line sloping away from the source region that allows upward wave activity to spread throughout a much wider area. Figure summarizes this relationship, plotting time series of the zonal mean zonal winds at 40°N and 0.02 hPa from 15 May to 31 August of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Focusing on the month of July, the zonal mean easterly flow was strongest in 2009, when the [0.5,3] Q2DW amplitudes were largest. During July 2007, when Q2DW amplitudes were smallest, the zonal mean easterlies peaked briefly in early July and remained relatively weak thereafter. The EP‐flux diagnostics based on the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields indicate that the Q2DW originates from baroclinic instabilities near the equatorward flank of the mesospheric summer easterly jet. The interannual variability of the Q2DW amplitudes in NH summer over the 2007–2009 period closely follows interannual variability in the strength and position of the summer easterly jet core, which determines the locations of the critical lines for the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW. As the results in show, both wave number 3 and wave number 4 components of the Q2DW are of comparable magnitude in NH summer, and they both exhibit a high degree of variability throughout the summer season. In the next section, we use a linearized instability model to examine this intraseasonal variability in more detail. Instability Model Results The results in the preceding sections show that both wave number 3 and wave number 4 components of the Q2DW arise from baroclinically unstable regions near the summer easterly jet at midlatitudes in the NH mesosphere. As Figures and illustrate, amplitudes of the [0.5,3] component are typically largest in July, while amplitudes of the [0.5,4] component peak intermittently throughout the period from late June to mid‐August. This variability is consistent with an earlier study of the NH Q2DW by Tunbridge et al. [ ], which showed that in some years the amplitude of the [0.5,4] component surpasses the amplitude of the [0.5,3] component in August. To better understand the origins of this behavior, we use a simple linear instability model to examine the characteristics of the fastest‐growing unstable modes in the MLT region near the NH summer easterly jet. This approach has been used to study other types of free traveling planetary waves in the MLT [e.g., Hartmann , ; Manney and Randel , ]. The model is based on the linearized quasi‐geostrophic potential vorticity equation for frictionless, adiabatic flow on a β ‐plane centered at midlatitudes [see, e.g., Andrews et al. , , equation 3.4.5]: _placeholder_formula_ Here the potential vorticity is derived from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA horizontal wind fields. Formulating the zonal wind and potential vorticity distributions in terms of the geostrophic stream function and assuming periodic solutions as functions of both longitude and time allows equation to be cast as an eigenvalue problem of the form _placeholder_formula_ where x is the state vector represented by gridded values of the stream function and the complex phase speed c is the eigenvalue. The operator A is determined from _placeholder_formula_ and _placeholder_formula_ , the operator B is determined from the finite‐differenced potential vorticity equation; both A and B depend on the zonal wave number. To simplify the calculation, the daily averaged values of NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind fields are subsampled onto the instability model domain, which consists of a uniform grid with 20 points in latitude extending from 20°N to 60° N latitude and 26 points in altitude extending from 65 to 90 km. For a given day, A and B are constructed from the geostrophic stream function and potential vorticity using these subsampled daily averaged zonal winds. Standard numerical codes are then used to solve the eigenvalue problem and obtain x (i.e., the wave modes) and c (i.e., phase speeds) for zonal wave numbers 1 through 6. The fastest growing modes are evaluated in terms of their e ‐folding times, which are determined from the inverse of the imaginary component of the phase speed for each zonal wave number. The periods of the unstable modes are determined from the real component of the phase speed (positive values indicate westward propagation). In addition, each mode's spatial structure contains wind and temperature information from which EP fluxes can be computed. In this discussion, we focus on the summer of 2009 when the Q2DW was most prominent. We first examine model output for two individual cases: 10 July and 5 August. These cases were chosen to highlight the development of the [0.5,3] and [0.5,4] components of the Q2DW, respectively, during the NH summer of 2009. Figure a plots the zonal wind and _placeholder_formula_ distributions over the model domain for the 10 July case. We find that zonal wave numbers 3–5 exhibit the fastest growth rates, with e ‐folding times of ~8–9 days (Figure b). The normalized stream function amplitudes of waves 1–4 (Figure c– e) maximize in the region between 30°N and 40°N and 60–70 km, which closely resembles the observed spatial structure of the [0.5,3] temperature Q2DW in Figure . In general, the period of the fastest‐growing modes decreases with increasing horizontal scale. On this particular day, the zonal wave number 3 (Figure e) solution has a period of 2 days, and the wave number 4 solution has a period of 1.5 days. Figure plots instability model results for the 5 August 2009 case. We find that the fastest‐growing modes are again at zonal wave numbers 3–5 (Figure b). However, the e ‐folding times of 3–4 days are much shorter than the July case. The spatial structure of the waves in this case now exhibits two maxima (Figures c– e) centered near 35°N and 45°N. For this August case, the zonal wave number 3 (Figure e) solution has a period of 3.1 days and the wave number 4 solution has a period of 2.3 days. The results from these two cases show that the growth time of the Q2DW decreased by a factor of 2–3 between early July and early August 2009. To determine if this is a systematic effect, the stability model was applied to daily average NOGAPS‐ALPHA zonal wind fields throughout the period from 5 June to 10 August 2009. Figure plots the resulting values of the period and growth time for both wave number 3 and 4 solutions. For plotting purposes, these time series have been smoothed using a three‐point running average. During much of June and early July, both wave numbers have periods near 2 days (Figure a). Starting in mid‐July, the periods increase sharply and then vary in the 3–7 day range thereafter. By late summer, the period of wave number 4 is consistently 1–2 days shorter than wave number 3. The growth time of wave number 4 is shorter than wave number 3 throughout most of the summer (Figure b), and the growth times of wave numbers 3 and 4 both decrease sharply during late July and early August. These calculations have also been performed for the summers of 2007 and 2008, and similar decreases in growth times from July to August were found in each case (not shown). The results from these types of model calculations can be highly sensitive to the curvature of the zonal wind fields, and thus averaging or smoothing of the input dynamical fields can affect the results. We present these calculations to better understand, in a qualitative sense, possible factors that contribute to the observed intraseasonal variability of the NH Q2DW. From these results, we can conclude that the baroclinically unstable region along the equatorward flank of the NH summer easterly jet produces the fastest‐growing modes at wave numbers 3–5. During June and July, the periods of the wave number 3 and 4 modes most closely match the 2 day period of the Rossby normal mode, and these grow preferentially over other modes. These results alone do not explain why the observed [0.5,3] component of the Q2DW is larger during July while the [0.5,4] component is larger in June and August. Nor do they account for the sporadic behavior of the Q2DW which tends to produce the double peaked structure observed in, e.g., Figure . However, based on the observational and model results presented here, we speculate that one possible explanation for this behavior may be that the faster growing wave number 4 unstable mode tends to emerge initially in June, only to be overtaken by the slower growing wave number 3 mode. When the Q2DW amplitudes and associated EP fluxes grow large enough to become unstable and dissipate, they modify the vertical shear structure in the background zonal wind such that it no longer produces fast‐growing unstable modes at zonal wave numbers 3 and 4 with periods near 2 days. This would be consistent with the sudden increase in the period of the unstable wave 3 and wave 4 modes in mid‐July 2009 (Figure a). As baroclinically unstable regions near the easterly jet reform after the Q2DW dissipates, another fast‐growing zonal wave 4 mode can emerge in late July or early August. However, by this time the effects of a weakening easterly jet (Figure ) and increasing tidal amplitudes (Figure ) will combine to limit growth of the slower [0.5,3] mode. Fully interactive GCM simulations are needed to test this hypothesis by studying the origin and growth of these various unstable modes in concert with fluctuations in the strength and curvature of the easterly jet for realistic conditions. Summary and Discussion Global synoptic meteorological analyses of the MLT from the NOGAPS‐ALPHA data assimilation system have provided, for the first time, a comprehensive description of variability in both Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide during the NH summers of 2007–2009. Unlike the SH case, where the Q2DW is primarily a westward propagating zonal wave number 3 feature, we find that the Q2DW in NH summer is composed primarily of westward propagating zonal wave number 3 and wave number 4 components that are comparable in magnitude, consistent with earlier observational studies. The wave number 3 component of the Q2DW typically peaks in July, while the wave number 4 component peaks intermittently throughout the period from late June to mid‐August. We do not find evidence for significant Q2DW activity in the NH extratropics outside of the June–August periods of 2007–2009. Of the three summer periods examined here, the monthly mean wave number 3 Q2DW amplitudes are largest in July 2009 and smallest in July 2007, whereas the amplitudes of the diurnal migrating tide at 30°N are largest in July 2007 and smallest in 2009. Diagnostic calculations based on NOGAPS‐ALPHA output indicate that the Q2DW originates from baroclinically unstable regions on the equatorward flank of the summer easterly jet near the 0.1 hPa level (~65–70 km). The vertical propagation of the Q2DW activity appears to be controlled by the location of the critical line. The large wave number 3 amplitudes observed during July 2009 coincide with a relatively strong and well‐defined easterly jet core that directed more wave activity upward compared to July 2007, when the jet core was smaller and weaker. Results from a linearized instability model using daily NOGAPS‐ALPHA winds for summer 2009 as input show that the baroclinically unstable region near the summer easterly jet supports growth of both zonal wave number 3 and 4 disturbances with periods near 2 days. The growth times of these disturbances are typically in the range of 10–20 days during July, but approach ~5 days in early August. Using a similar modeling approach based on winds from a mechanistic global circulation model (GCM), Rojas and Norton [ ] found evidence for two zonal wave number 3 modes with growth times between 3 and 5 days: a faster growing mode with period of 35 h and a slower growing mode with a period of 42 h. In this study, Rojas and Norton [ ] found that the faster growing mode quickly reached saturation at relatively small amplitude while the slower growing mode continued to grow to much larger amplitude and then began to interact with the background flow. We plan to pursue this subject further by conducting free‐running model simulations using the NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields as initial conditions to determine whether the [0.5,3] component interacts with the [0.5,4] components as it grows, or if the two components grow independently from one other. We do not find evidence for Q2DW‐tide interaction that can sometimes lead to rapid amplification of the Q2DW in SH summer [e.g., Norton and Thuburn , ; Palo et al. , ; McCormack et al. , ; Hecht et al. , ; Chang et al. , ; Yue et al. , ]. This is likely due to the smaller amplitudes and more broad band nature of the Q2DW in NH summer compared to SH summer, which reduces the chances for the type of interaction described by Walterscheid and Vincent [ ]. A modeling study of the SH Q2DW in January by Chang et al. [ ] found that nonlinear advection of momentum by the Q2DW itself may introduce variations in the background flow and, by extension, in tidal amplitudes that can also account for anticorrelation between the Q2DW and migrating diurnal tide. Other factors controlling the year‐to‐year variations in the strength and location of the NH summer easterly jet such as gravity wave activity [ Ern et al. , ] may also play a role in controlling the behavior of both the Q2DW and tides. To further investigate the nature of possible coupling between the Q2DW, gravity waves, and tides in NH summer, a targeted series of global circulation model (GCM) experiments capable of accurately simulating the evolution of the background zonal flow throughout the NH summer MLT is needed. Recently, Sassi et al. [ ] used a GCM driven by NOGAPS‐ALPHA meteorological fields in the lower atmosphere to generate a Q2DW in the SH summer MLT internally through baroclinic instability processes, rather than through means of an imposed forcing [e.g., Chang et al. , ]. A future study will use a similar approach for the NH summer cases of 2007–2009 to more closely examine possible sources of the interseasonal and interannual variability in the NH summer Q2DW presented here.

By 2008 the annual average mixing ratios of these gases in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere had reached 1864 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively. CH 4 has a 100 year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 25 based on an adjustment time (lifetime) of 12 years, whereas N 2 O has a 100 year GWP of 298 and an adjustment time of 114 years [ ]. Globally the principle anthropogenic sources of CH 4 in Tg(CH 4 ) a −1 are agriculture (107–175), waste (35–69), energy (74–77), coal mining (30–46), oil and gas industry (52–68) and biomass and biofuel burning (14–88). For N 2 O the principal global anthropogenic sources, in Tg(N) a −1 , are agriculture (1.7–4.8), industrial processes (0.2–1.8), rivers/coastal waters (0.5–2.9) and biomass burning (0.2–1.0). The values in brackets show the range of emission estimates from various studies as reported by . In NW Europe (Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, hereafter referred to as NWEU), the principle anthropogenic sources of CH 4 in 2006 were reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ( ) to be agriculture (58%), waste (26%) and energy (16%). The natural sources of CH 4 , globally significant through wetland emissions, are thought to be small in comparison to the anthropogenic releases in the NWEU. For N 2 O in 2006, the principle anthropogenic sources in the NWEU as reported to the UNFCCC are agriculture (71%), industrial processes (14%), energy (12%) and waste (3%) and again the natural sources are considered to be small in comparison. The anthropogenic emissions of both gases in the NWEU are covered by the UNFCCC reporting process. Inverse modeling has been used to estimate global and regional surface emissions of CH 4 [ ; ; , ; ; ; ; ] and N 2 O [ ; ; ; ]. Fewer inversion studies have attempted to estimate regional‐ to country‐scale emissions [ ; ]. estimate country, regional and global emissions for three greenhouse gases, HFC‐134a, HFC‐152a and HCFC‐22 for 2005–2007. Their approach uses the FLEXPART Lagrangian model to describe the recent history of the air that reaches nine observation stations globally distributed. They use a priori emission maps and an inversion method that estimates both the baseline and the regional emissions that form part of the global estimates. present a global inversion of CH 4 with a zoom component over Europe for the year 2001. The inversion system uses a priori data and many high‐frequency and weekly observations distributed globally but focused in Europe to estimate annual emissions from the countries in Europe. The results for Germany, France and the United Kingdom suggest the inventories are significantly (50–90%) underreported. Germany has since recalculated its reported emissions for 2001. Subsequent inventory recalculations for the United Kingdom have lead to an increase of 38% for 2001 short of the 93% suggested by . Further recent work by shows they have revised their UK CH 4 estimates downward and they are now much more aligned with the current increased inventory estimates. One of the issues with the 2005 work was the coarse resolution of the computational grid used in the analysis (1°) and this was particularly problematic for the Mace Head station in westerly airflows. As a result the estimated modeled Irish emissions were lower than the reported UNFCCC values and explain to some degree the modeled compensating elevated UK emissions. In the work presented here more than 20 years of high‐frequency, in situ CH 4 and N 2 O observations (1989 to April 2009) from Mace Head, a remote observation station on the west coast of Ireland, have been used. This work follows on from the work presented by , where 5 year estimates of CH 4 and N 2 O were presented for NWEU. A recent paper by confirmed that the Mace Head station is sensitive to emissions in Ireland, the United Kingdom and NW continental Europe, consistent with the region considered in this paper. The observations have been used to estimate, for both gases, the trends in background midlatitude Northern Hemisphere mixing ratios (baseline) and for the more limited period, 1990–2007, the UK and NWEU emissions. These estimates have been compared to those reported to the UNFCCC in 2009 which cover the period 1990–2007. The principle tool used in the analysis of the Mace Head observations is the NAME dispersion model (Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modelling Environment) developed by the UK Met Office [ ; ]. The NAME atmospheric dispersion tool has been used for a diverse range of applications, e.g., air quality [ ; ], emergency response [ ; ] and inversion modeling [ ; ; ; ]. Observations Since 1987, 40 min in situ CH 4 measurements have been made as part of the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE) and since 1994 as part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) at Mace Head, Ireland (53.3°N, 9.9°W). CH 4 is measured in air samples with the “AGAGE‐MD” system with gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 5880) and flame ionization detection. Samples are injected at 20 min intervals, with alternate ambient air and standard gas samples, giving a total of 36 calibrated air measurements per day. The calibration scale was established by Tohoku University based on gravimetric preparation of mixtures by Nippon Sanso. A detailed description of this calibration is reported by and . The choice of calibration scale affects the absolute magnitude of the baseline concentrations but has no effect on the inversion results. For much of the time, the measurement station, which is situated on the Atlantic coast, monitors clean westerly air that has traveled across the North Atlantic Ocean (34–51% of the time). However, when the winds are easterly, Mace Head receives substantial regional‐scale pollution in air that has traveled from the industrial regions of Europe (18–35% of the time). The site is therefore uniquely situated to record trace gas mixing ratios associated with both the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere background levels and with the more polluted air arising from Europe. The percentage average annual and monthly contributions from different geographical regions are shown in and , respectively. The definitions of the different categories are given in . No long‐term annual trend in the air mass classifications is discernible. There is a seasonal signal with more “Local” and “Mixed Origin” periods and fewer “European” periods in the summer (May‐September) periods. The sum of “Mixed Origin,” “European” and “Baseline” periods, i.e., those used in the inversion process, shows no annual trend and only a modest seasonal cycle (9% amplitude) with a April‐July minima. NAME Dispersion Model NAME is a Lagrangian particle model that can be driven by stored three‐dimensional meteorological fields from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. In this work two independent sets of meteorology have been used to drive NAME: the Met Office's operational global NWP model, the Unified Model (referred to as UKMO) [ ], and the recently available reanalysis meteorology, ERA Interim (referred to as ERAI) [ ], produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The former is available from 1995 onward to current day and has undergone episodic improvements over the entire period but principally, with resolution upgrades, in 1999, 2002 and 2005. At the time of writing, ERAI meteorology was available from 1989 until 2008. It has the advantage of using a consistent model configuration throughout this time period. The meteorology from both models is a sequence of short‐term forecasts that are produced from successive meteorological analyses. These analysis states use the available meteorological observations (land surface, ocean, satellite, etc.) to constrain the model state to the evolution of the real atmosphere. UKMO has a horizontal resolution of ∼60 km pre‐December 2005 and then ∼40 km onward, the number of vertical levels used by NAME has increased from 11 (1995–1998) to 31 (from December 2005 to June 2009). ERAI is a spectral model with an equivalent horizontal resolution of 0.75° (∼80 km) and NAME uses its lowest 37 vertical levels. NAME was initially developed, more than 20 years ago, as an emergency response tool following the Chernobyl disaster but has since evolved into a general purpose dispersion model covering spatial scales from a few hundred meters to global scales. The model air parcels move in a three‐dimensional space driven by either three‐dimensional NWP meteorology or single‐site observations. A random walk technique is used to simulate atmospheric turbulence. In the boundary layer, profiles of turbulence are estimated [ ], these converge at the top of the boundary layer to a small value in the free troposphere with a fixed standard deviation ( σ u = 0.25 m s −1 and σ w = 0.1 m s −1 ). In the work presented here the model schemes for representing chemistry, dry deposition, wet deposition and radioactive decay were not used, i.e., the gases were considered to be inert tracers, which, given their long respective atmospheric lifetimes and the fact the model domain was limited to the European/North Atlantic region was considered to be appropriate. The most significant loss process to consider here is OH oxidation of methane, however, over a 12 d period, with typical OH levels, the depletion in methane from OH oxidation amounts to ∼0.7%. Even with ten times the amount of OH, such as would be seen in a strong photochemical ozone episode, the depletion would only be 7%. This is trivial in comparison with the other uncertainties. The depletions from surface uptake of methane would be even smaller than from OH depletion. The boundary layer depth (BLD) estimates are taken from the driving NWP meteorological model except for pre‐August 2002 UKMO (unavailable). Pre‐August 2002, NAME directly estimates the BLD as described by . The minimum BLD allowed within NAME was set to 100 m to be consistent with the maximum emission height and the height of the output grid. The impact of using different BLD estimates is further discussed in . The NAME model is run in backward mode to estimate the recent history (12 d) of the air en route to Mace Head. An air history map, such as those shown in , has been calculated for each 3 h period from 1995 until June 2009 using UKMO and from 1989 to 2008 using ERAI, amounting to more than 90,000 maps. The model output estimates the 12 d time‐integrated air concentration (dosage) at each grid box (fixed at 40 km horizontal resolution and 0–100 m above ground level irrespective of meteorology used) from a release of 1 g s −1 at Mace Head (the receptor). The model is three‐dimensional therefore it is not just surface to surface transport that is modeled. An air parcel can travel from the surface to a high altitude and then back to the surface but only those times when the air parcel is within the lowest 100 m above the ground will it be recorded in the maps. The computational domain covers 100.0°W to 45.125°E longitude and 10.0°N to 80.125°N latitude and extends to more than 10 km vertically. For each 3 h period 33,000 inert model particles were used to describe the dispersion, increasing the number of particles has been shown to have negligible impact on the noise within the inversion domain. By dividing the dosage [g s m −3 ] by the total mass emitted [3600 s h −1 × 3 h × 1 g s −1 ] and multiplying by the geographical area of each grid box [m 2 ], the model output is converted into a dilution matrix D [s m −1 ]. Each element of this matrix D dilutes a continuous emission ( ) of 1 g m −2 s −1 from a given grid box over the previous 12 d to an air concentration [g m −3 ] at the receptor ( ) during a 3 h period (). _placeholder_formula_ Running the model backward in this way, compared to a forward simulation, is very computationally efficient as every modeled particle has a direct impact on the solution. However, it should be noted that backward running is only a very close approximation to running forward, it is not exactly reversible. Baseline Concentration Analysis Baseline concentrations are defined as those that have not been influenced by significant emissions within the previous 12 d of travel en route to Mace Head, i.e., those that are well mixed and are representative of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere background concentrations. The observations at Mace Head from 1989 to June 2009 have been analyzed for each gas measured. The analysis considers the long‐term trend of the monthly and annual baseline mixing ratios, their rate of growth and their seasonal cycle. Defining Baseline Observations A 3 h period is classed as “baseline” if it meets certain criteria with respect to a dilution sensitivity limit. The dilution sensitivity limit is attempting to define a threshold above which an emission source would generate a concentration at Mace Head that would be discernible above the baseline noise. As this limit is based on the NAME dilution calculations it is independent of the gas species and therefore the same limit value can be used for both of the gases analyzed. The criteria are: 1. The total air concentration from the nine grid boxes centered on and surrounding Mace Head is less than ten times the dilution sensitivity limit, i.e., local emissions do not significantly contribute. 2. The total air concentration contribution from the European landmass is less than five times the dilution sensitivity limit, i.e., European emissions do not significantly contribute. 3. The contribution from the southerly latitudes is less than twice the dilution sensitivity limit indicating that southerly latitude air, with a different baseline concentration, is not significantly present. For both gases there is a strong hemispheric gradient because of disproportionately higher emissions in the Northern Hemisphere. In previous work the noise in the CH 4 observations classed as baseline was ∼10 ppb. For a CH 4 emission to be discernible at Mace Head, its impact there must be >∼10 ppb. In this work we have arbitrarily chosen 100 kt CH 4 a −1 gridbox −1 (∼4% of the total UK CH 4 emission) to be the minimum discernible emission, this equates to emissions of ∼2 μ g m −2 s −1 , 0.5 μ g m −2 s −1 and 0.125 μ g m −2 s −1 at 40 km, 80 km and 160 km grid box resolution, respectively, and delivers a dilution sensitivity limit of 3.4 s m −1 . Choosing a larger (smaller) minimum discernible emission reduces (increases) the dilution sensitivity limit and thus increases (decreases) the resolution of the gridded output, but will reduce (increase) the emission sensitivity of the grid boxes. The chosen limit is arbitrary but sensitivity analysis, discussed in , shows that the impact of this choice is small. shows a 3 month extract of the CH 4 observations measured at Mace Head. The observations have been color coded to indicate whether, using the above classification, the air mass they were sampled from was considered baseline. For this baseline analysis all nonbaseline observations are removed. Removing Outliers and Smoothing the Baseline The points defined as baseline using the above methodology still have a certain level of noise. The principle reasons for this are: emissions from the populated regions of the USA and Canada; unexpected emissions (for instance, forest fires in Canada or shipping); local emissions that are not identified using the above criteria; incorrectly modeled meteorology or transport (i.e., European air defined as baseline by error). Irrespective of the methodology used to identify these events some will inevitably be classed as baseline when it is inappropriate to do so. To capture such events the baseline data are statistically filtered, within a moving 40 d window, to isolate and remove these outliers that are actually nonbaseline observations. The observations removed through applying this statistical filter are shown in green in . For each hour in the time series the remaining baseline points in a running 40 d window are fitted using a quadratic function and the value extracted for the current hour in question. The process is then advanced by an hour and repeated. Finally, the baseline time series is smoothed using the median value within a moving 20 d time window. The choice of the length of the time windows and number of points is arbitrary. It is a balance between using sufficient baseline points while still capturing the seasonal signal. Modest (±50%) changes to these values have little impact on the resulting baseline concentration. Baseline Noise The noise or potential error in the smoothed baseline mixing ratio is estimated to be the standard deviation of the difference between the observations classed as baseline and the smoothed baseline mixing ratios at the corresponding times. shows, on a much expanded y axis compared to , the typical spread of baseline observations about the smoothed continuous baseline estimate. For CH 4 the baseline noise over 1989–2008 using ERAI is 8.7 ppb (assuming average 1860 ppb baseline for CH 4 this is 0.47%) and over 1995–2009 using UKMO is 8.3 ppb (0.45%), the values for N 2 O are 0.25 ppb (0.08% assuming average baseline of 320 ppb) and 0.19 ppb (0.06%), respectively. If the same period (1995–2008) is analyzed, the noise values for ERAI and UKMO are closer still, with a 0.3 ppb difference for CH 4 and a 0.002 ppb difference for N 2 O. This shows the reduction in magnitude from using ERAI over the entire period 1989–2008 to using UKMO is partially a result of the improved accuracy of the observations from 1994 onward rather than because of the different meteorology. Baseline Analysis Monthly baseline mixing ratios are estimated by averaging all of the hourly baseline values within the appropriate time window. A monthly value is estimated provided hourly values span at least two thirds of the month, this ensures the value is representative of the baseline concentration across the whole month. Using this methodology all months, from February 1989, are assigned baseline mixing ratios. The baseline analysis has been conducted with both sets of meteorology. The differences in the estimated monthly baseline mixing ratios are small, the mean difference in monthly baseline for CH 4 is 0.1 ppb ( σ = 0.93 ppb) and for N 2 O is 0.01 ppb ( σ = 0.01 ppb), in both cases the baseline derived using ERAI is, on average, marginally higher. The monthly baseline mixing ratios from both analyses are shown in . As a sensitivity test, the impact of adding 50% to the dilution sensitivity limit was investigated using the ERAI. The mean difference in the monthly baseline using the two different limit values was found to be negligible, 0.1 ppb ( σ = 1.1 ppb) for CH 4 and 0.01 ppb ( σ = 0.02 ppb) for N 2 O. This is comparable to the difference because of the choice of meteorology. The annual growth rate on a particular day is defined as the current daily baseline value minus the previous year's value on the same day, e.g., growth rate for 14 January 1996 = (daily baseline for 14 January 1996) – (daily baseline for 14 January 1995). By averaging the annual growth rate values (one per day) within a running 12 month period (6 months either side of the day), a smoothed annual growth rate per day is estimated. Monthly averages of these growth rates are shown in . Over the 20 year period the average CH 4 growth rate is 3.9 ppb a −1 but with significant variability year to year (peaks in 1991, 1998–1999, 2003, 2007–2008). The N 2 O growth rate has been much more consistent at 0.7 ppb a −1 but still with variability, with peaks in 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007–2008 and troughs in between. To illustrate the seasonal cycles of CH 4 and N 2 O, the monthly baseline mixing ratios are detrended and presented in for the baseline derived from ERAI. The spread shows the extent of the year to year variability. CH 4 has a peak mixing ratio in February‐April (+9 ppb) and a minimum in July (−18 ppb). A similar cycle is shown for N 2 O, peak in March‐April (+0.26 ppb) and trough in August (−0.41 ppb). However, the reasons for these seasonal cycles are different. For CH 4 , it is the loss through OH chemistry that drives the cycle with OH production at a maximum in August. For N 2 O, the seasonal cycle is due to the seasonality in; surface sources, transport between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and transport of N 2 O‐poor air from the stratosphere to the troposphere. The observed summertime minimum in tropospheric N 2 O in the Northern Hemisphere is reported to result from the propagation of springtime lower stratospheric minima down to the troposphere with a ∼4 month lag time [ ; ; ]. Regional Emission Estimates By removing the time‐varying baseline mixing ratios from the raw observation data, a time series of excursions from the baseline for each observed gas has been generated (1995–2009 using UKMO and 1989–2008 using ERAI). The observed deviations from baseline are averaged over each 3 h period. Negative perturbations are set to zero. For CH 4 (N 2 O), the average percentage of negative perturbations per year was 38% (35%), but the values were generally small, median = −5.9 ppb (−0.1 ppb), and below the noise in the baseline estimate, 8.7 ppb (0.25 ppb). Because of the way the baseline is constructed, it is not surprising that around half of the baseline observations (∼45% of observations, see ) lead to small negative perturbations. These observed deviations are assumed to be driven by emissions on regional scales that have yet to be fully mixed on the hemisphere scale. Henceforth these baseline‐removed observations are referred to as simply the observations. shows the number of observations per year classed as European that are above 200 ppb for CH 4 and above 4.5 ppb for N 2 O. Over the 20 year period the number of events for N 2 O has declined (linear regression: −0.14 a −1 ) but a similar trend is not seen in the CH 4 observations (−0.01 a −1 ). From this basic analysis it would tentatively suggest that the regional N 2 O emissions have declined over time, or at least some significant sources have been removed, whereas the regional CH 4 emissions have seen no observable change in their frequency. Inversion Methodology The observation time series, together with the NAME model output predicting the recent history of the air, were used to estimate the emission distribution of each gas over NWEU. The iterative best fit technique, simulated annealing [ ], was used to derive these regional emission estimates based on a statistical skill score (cost function) comparing the observed and modeled time series at Mace Head. The technique starts from a set of randomly generated emission maps, it then searches for the emission map that leads to a modeled time series at Mace Head that most accurately mimics the observations. The aim of the inversion method is to estimate the spatial distribution of emissions across a defined geographical area ( e ) using . The emissions are assumed to be constant in time over the analysis period. The observations are converted from volume mixing ratio [ppb] to air concentration [g m −3 ] using the modeled temperature and pressure at the observation point. Inversion Domain and Grid Resolution The inversion domain is chosen to be a smaller subset of the full domain used for the air history maps. It covers 30°W–42°E longitude and 29.3°N–77.3°N latitude and is shown as the black box in . The smaller domain covers all of Europe and extends a reasonable distance into the Atlantic. The inversion domain needs to be smaller to ensure recirculating air masses are fully represented but also because emission sources very distant from Mace Head have little discernible impact on the concentration at the station, i.e., the signal would be too weak to be seen. The inversion method assumes baseline concentration air enters the inversion domain regardless of direction. For the eastern and southern edges in particular this assumption will be incorrect. Emissions in Russia and around the Black Sea would be expected to elevate the atmospheric concentrations along the eastern edge, and because of the latitudinal gradient it would be reasonable to assume below midlatitudinal baseline concentration air enters from the south. This issue is overcome in the inversion by solving for but not analyzing the estimated emissions in any grid box on the edge of the inversion domain. It is assumed that the error of above or below baseline concentration air entering the domain will be absorbed into the solutions in these edge grid boxes. This assumption has been tested by comparing the solutions for the United Kingdom with this domain to those obtained when a significantly larger inversion domain is used. The results of this comparison are discussed in . In order for the best fit algorithm to provide robust solutions for every area within the domain, each region needs to significantly contribute to the air concentration at Mace Head on a reasonable number of time periods. If the signal from an area is only rarely or poorly seen at Mace Head, then its impact on the cost function is minimal and the inversion method has little skill at determining its true emission. The contribution that different grid boxes make to the air concentration observed varies from grid box to grid box. Grid boxes that are distant from the observation site contribute relatively little to the observation, whereas those that are close can have a large impact. In order to balance the contribution from different grid boxes, those that are more distant are grouped together into increasingly larger blocks. The grouping varies for each time period considered and between the different gases because of varying meteorology and the impact of missing observations, respectively. The underlying horizontal grid resolution is 40 km (= x ), which is equal to the resolution of the NAME output. The grouping creates blocks that have a resolution of x , 2 x , 4 x , 8 x , 16 x and 32x. An emission sensitivity level [g m −2 s −1 ] has been estimated for each gas. Below this level the impact of the emission at the receptor is assumed lost within the baseline noise of the observation. The dilution sensitivity limit threshold (3.4 s m −1 ), as derived in the baseline analysis, is used again. Baseline noise is defined as the standard deviation of baseline observations about the defined smoothed baseline value, as discussed in . The values are 8.7 ppb (6 μ g m −3 ) for CH 4 and 0.25 ppb (0.48 μ g m −3 ) for N 2 O using ERAI at standard temperature and pressure. The emission sensitivity for CH 4 is thus defined to be 1.8 μ g m −2 s −1 (∼90 kt a −1 for a 40 km grid box) and for N 2 O to be 0.14 μ g m −2 s −1 (∼7 kt a −1 for a 40 km grid box). For each grid box the number of times it provides a contribution to Mace Head above the dilution sensitivity limit threshold is calculated from the dilution matrix. If this is below the minimum number required (arbitrarily defined as 240 3 h time periods, i.e., 30 d) within the 3 year period, then a grid resolution twice as coarse is considered. This process is repeated until the condition is satisfied or until the grid resolution is 32 times the original (32 x ) ( ), where x = ∼40 km. Inversion Process The modeled time series at the measurement station is calculated by applying the current hypothesized emission map to the dilution matrix (). The inversion process works by iteratively choosing different emissions, varying the emission magnitudes and distributions, with the aim of minimizing the mismatch between the observations and the modeled concentrations. No a priori conditions are set, with the exception that no emissions are allowed to be negative. The relative skill of a derived emission map is tested by comparing the modeled and observed time series by using a cost function that combines four different statistics. Other cost functions were investigated, for example; root mean square error, varying the weights applied to the different statistics; and, removing one of the four statistics, using the pseudo data experiment (see ) but were found to be less accurate at recreating a prescribed (known) emission distribution. _placeholder_formula_ where r = Pearson correlation coefficient NMSE = Normalized Mean Square Error: fac2 = Fraction within a factor of 2 of observations facNoise = Fraction of model values within Noise of the observations Noise = Standard deviation of baseline observations about the defined smoothed baseline value. Note observations below the Noise level are considered to have a magnitude equal to the Noise level with respect to the fac2 calculation. The iteration process is repeated until any potential improvement in skill in the emission map is estimated to be negligible. To simulate uncertainties in the meteorology, dispersion and observations a time series of random noise is applied to the observations. The random element is multiplicative and taken from a lognormal distribution with mean one and variance, arbitrarily, set to one fifth of the Noise . Any observations that are negative are considered to be zero. For each time period solved for, the whole inversion process is repeated multiple times (arbitrarily set to 52) to give a robust indication of the potential uncertainty in the emission solution, each time with a different random starting point and a different time series of random noise. Solutions are calculated for 3 year periods covering the period when observations are available. After solutions have been estimated for a particular 3 year period, the period is moved forward by 1 month and the process repeated, e.g., January 1995 to December 1997, February 1995 to January 1998. An annual estimate of emissions is calculated by averaging all of the solutions that contain a complete calendar year (1300 solutions) within the solved‐for time period. The range for each year for each geographical region is calculated from the same sample of 1300 solutions and is taken as the 5th and 95th percentile. Observations Used in the Inversion Any periods that were classed as baseline but were removed by the statistical filtering are removed from the analysis as these are considered to be unrepresentative of air from that sector. Times when the air is classed as “local” are likewise removed from the analysis. A 3 h period is classed as local if the contribution from the 9 grid boxes surrounding Mace Head is above fifteen times the dilution sensitivity limit. The local times represent periods when the emissions from the local area (120 km × 120 km area centered on Mace Head) would have a dominant effect on the observations. These are typically characterized by low wind speeds, low boundary layer heights and thus poor dispersion conditions. During such times the meteorological models used, with horizontal resolutions of between 40 and 80 km, are poor at resolving the local flows as they are dominated by subgrid scale processes, e.g., land‐sea breezes. In all 86% (87%) of the CH 4 (N 2 O) observations were retained for analysis using ERAI. A similar percentage is retained when using UKMO. Pseudo Data Experiment To assess the ability of the inversion system to estimate correctly emissions on the regional scale, it was first applied to model derived pseudo observations. The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) ( ) were used to calculate a model time series at Mace Head. Time series were derived using both ERAI and UKMO. The inversion system was tested using the ERAI dilution matrix applied to, first, the pseudo observations derived using ERAI and then to the pseudo observations derived using UKMO. The latter test investigates the ability of the inversion system to estimate emissions with a system that has errors. The impact of applying random noise to the system is investigated by solving with and without noise. shows the time series of emission estimates and true emissions for NWEU in this idealized case study. The agreement between the median emission total and truth when no noise is added to the pseudo observations is excellent and the uncertainty bars are small. When noise is added to the measurements the median fit is still good but the uncertainty range is larger (solid lines). When a different meteorology is used to derive the pseudo observations and noise is added (dashed line) the fit is still good but the uncertainty range is at its largest. However, in every case the uncertainty range completely encompasses the true solution and gives confidence that the methodology is able to recreate the correct emission total within the estimated uncertainty range. Results is an example of the observed and modeled time series of the air mixing ratio for CH 4 for the first 3 months of 2006 at Mace Head. The modeled time series (gray) is a composite of all of the inversion solutions that cover this 3 month period. The magnitudes and patterns are similar and demonstrate that the inversion process is able to derive an emission map that produces a good match to the observations. shows the average (minimum and maximum) statistical fit between the observed and modeled time series at Mace Head for each year. and show examples of the average inversion emission maps for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively, for January 1990 to December 1992 ( , left, and , left) and January 2006 to December 2008 ( , right, and , right). The vast majority of the estimated emissions are land‐based as expected, although for N 2 O, there are significant emissions estimated in the North Sea. The application of fertilizer onto crops can leach into rivers and thereby reach the sea, therefore, it is entirely plausible that a reasonable amount of N 2 O could be released from the sea rather than the land. The relatively large‐sized grid boxes on the east of the United Kingdom also, in effect, smudge emissions over sea areas. This is why the geographical areas used to define UK and NWEU emissions extend out into the North Sea ( ). Emission totals from specific geographical areas are calculated by summing the emissions from each 40 km grid box in that region ( ). Emission estimates for N 2 O for the United Kingdom using both sets of meteorology are presented in time series graphs and compared to the reported UNFCCC values ( ). Similar graphs ( ) are shown for NW Europe with the United Kingdom removed (NWEU‐noUK). and show emission time series graphs for CH 4 . The NAME inversion annual emission estimates with uncertainties for the United Kingdom using ERAI for N 2 O and CH 4 are given in and , respectively, and are compared to the UNFCCC inventory estimates. Sensitivities and Uncertainties in the Inversion Methodology There is no absolute method of defining the uncertainties associated with these best fit estimates. They occur because of errors in the inversion process, in the input meteorology, in the transport modeling in NAME and in the observations. This section discusses the sensitivities of the inversion results to (1) choice of meteorology, (2) domain size, and (3) a bias in the baseline concentration, and discusses other areas of potential uncertainty and how these have been minimized. The NAME inversion results using ERAI and UKMO are presented ( – ). Although there are differences, within the uncertainty ranges there is good agreement between the solutions using different meteorologies. For CH 4 , the differences are all within the 25th–75th uncertainty range. For N 2 O there is a fairly consistent difference up until 2005, but always within the 5th–95th uncertainty range. In the early years of the comparison the UKMO results are lower than the ERAI results, in the latter years the reverse is the case. The reasons for this reversal are linked to the definition of the boundary layer height in the two models and how these have evolved over the years within the UKMO. compares the average monthly BLD modeled at Mace Head by the two meteorologies. The UKMO estimated BLD at Mace Head is on average lower than the ERAI estimated BLD however over the years the average difference between the two estimates has narrowed considerably. If this is generally the case over the whole domain the model with the lower BLD will enhance the modeled surface concentration for a given surface emission. This would then lead the inversions using UKMO to require lower emissions to model a given surface concentration and hence potentially explain some of the differences between the emission estimates using the two meteorologies. The periodic upgrades to the UKMO have meant that the location of the Mace Head station with respect to the meteorological grid has varied over the years which will mean that the amount of land to sea within the grid box will have changed and will alter the BLD estimates interpolated to the Mace Head station. Therefore without further analysis it is not possible to be definitive about the impact of the results shown in . The inversion method assumes that only baseline concentration air enters the domain. This does not always hold true. It is assumed that above (below) baseline air entering the domain will lead to elevated (depressed) emission estimates only at the edge of the domain. Therefore the inversion domain solved for is significantly larger than the NWEU domain and it is assumed that the majority of these edge effects will not impact on the analysis of NWEU and UK emission totals. and show the sensitivity of the NAME inversion UK estimates to a systematic bias in the baseline estimate, both positive and negative, and to using a larger domain for the inversion calculation. The baseline mixing ratio was first increased and then decreased by one standard deviation ( σ ) of the baseline noise. Each 3 year period (within 1989–2008) using ERAI was solved three times with no additional noise and the median annual estimate calculated as before. The red dash‐dot line shows the impact of lowering the baseline and the red dashed line the impact of increasing the baseline. The estimates as presented in and are also shown for comparison. For CH 4 the changes in the baseline are comfortably within the 25–75th percentile uncertainty ranges, showing that a bias of this magnitude is captured by the uncertainty analysis. For N 2 O the addition or subtraction of a bias in the baseline has an impact that is sometimes larger than the 5–95th percentile uncertainty ranges. Therefore the N 2 O totals are susceptible to a bias in the baseline mixing ratio and this could lead to an increase of up to 30% in the UK uncertainty estimates. The colored lines in and show the impact of increasing the domain (blue lines) as well as having a bias in the baseline mixing ratio (dashed and dash‐dot blue lines). The results are similar to those when the standard domain is used (black) and demonstrate that the inversion solution is largely insensitive to the domain size chosen. For N 2 O the impact is to generally lower (on average by 10%) the UK estimates, there is no impact for CH 4 outside the uncertainty ranges already presented. All of the emissions are assumed constant in time within a given 3 year period and are geographically static. This is clearly a significant simplification. A sudden, but subsequently maintained, change in emissions will be picked up by solving multiple 3 year periods covering slightly different time periods, i.e., solving for a 3 year period and then advancing by 1 month. Enhanced emissions in any particular season, e.g., increased N 2 O emissions in spring following fertilizer application, will not be resolved. Intermittent or sporadic emissions will be averaged and their “true” contribution maybe lost. All areas of the domain are assumed to impact reasonably equally on Mace Head given the dispersion and transport processes modeled by NAME. The grouping of grid boxes together, so that each area contributes approximately equally to the observations, attempts to ensure this but clearly there will be some variability. Also large grid boxes could have significant variability actually within the grid box itself especially if there are significant orographic features within the grid box, e.g., the Alps, or land‐sea boundaries. This may lead to errors if certain parts of the grid box are more frequently sampled than others. However, because of the large travel distances and therefore time elapsed between emission in these large grid boxes and measurement at Mace Head the impact of this will be small. Also by only reporting emissions within NWEU this issue is considered to be small. The inversion method makes no distinction between anthropogenic and natural sources and thus its estimates are for the combined total, making direct comparisons with the UNFCCC inventory difficult. From other studies the natural emissions in NWEU are estimated to be small in comparison to the anthropogenic emissions. For CH 4 the natural emissions in NWEU are estimated to be 240 kt a −1 [ ], less than 10% of the total emission. It is also important to recognize that the atmospheric release of N 2 O from agricultural practices, such as nitrogen fertilizer application, may occur at some considerable distances from the point of application because of transportation by rivers. This adds to the uncertainty of using the maps to attribute emissions to particular regions. The area considered to be the United Kingdom includes the waters directly surrounding the United Kingdom ( ) and so the impact of this is considered to be small for the United Kingdom. This would be problematic if the individual contributions of Belgium or The Netherlands for example were presented and is the reason why only the NWEU total is considered. The most significant region in relation to this issue is the border between Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland, however because of the proximity to Mace Head and the corresponding high resolution of the output in that area, the impact is small. The transport modeling and thus the inversion algorithm also assume that the loss processes associated with each gas are negligible within the regional domain. Given the atmospheric lifetimes of both of the gases studied here, 8.7 years (CH 4 ) and 114 years (N 2 O) [ ], this is considered to be a robust assumption. Discussion Considering the N 2 O results, and show the inventory and inversion estimates for the United Kingdom throughout the whole 18 year period. The inventory estimates are reported to have an uncertainty of 252% ( , UK National Inventory Report, 2010) and estimate there is a 95% probability the UK N 2 O emissions in 2008 were between 33% and 73% below the level in 1990. The inversion results are consistently lower than the inventory estimates (20–50 kt a −1 ). However, the trend comparison is excellent, the inversion results estimate there is a 95% probability that the UK emissions in 2007 are between 34% and 70% below the level in 1990, and are estimated to have fallen by 5.1 kt a −1 compared to the inventory rate of fall of 5.8 kt a −1 . The step change in the emission total in 1999 appears in both estimates although smoothed in the inversion estimates because of the 3 year averaging period. In the inventory this step is related to the application of an abatement technology at an adipic acid plant in the northeast of England, a similar technology was also fitted to an adipic acid plant in Germany in 1997. The agreement between the inversion estimates and the inventory would imply that the reported reduction in emissions because of the new UK technology was achieved. The results for NWEU with the United Kingdom removed (NWEU‐noUK) ( ) show the inversion estimates are again consistently lower than the inventory estimates (60–240 kt a −1 ). Both estimates show an overall reduction in emissions, but the inversion results show a significant rise in emissions over the period 1990–1995 that is not seen in the inventory. The results for CH 4 for the United Kingdom ( and ) show a more significant difference. The NAME inversion estimates show a modest decline 1990–1993 but since have remained approximately constant, within the uncertainty ranges. The NAME inversion UK emissions in 2007 are estimated to be 41% (median) below the level in 1990, but with a very large spread (25th to 75th percentile range is 16% to 60%, and the 95% probability range is 83% below to 78% above). The UNFCCC inventory estimates are reported to have an uncertainty of 23% ( , UK National Inventory Report, 2010), estimate there is a 95% probability the UK CH 4 emissions in 2008 were between 50% and 56% below the level in 1990 and show a marked and monotonic decline over the whole period. There is a significant difference in the trend in the emission estimates, the UNFCCC inventory estimates have decreased by 170 kt a −1 compared to a modest decrease of 22 kt a −1 in the NAME inversion estimates. The agreement over the period 2000–2008 is good, the inventory estimates are within the 25th–75th NAME inversion uncertainty range for each year. The estimates for NWEU‐noUK show reasonable agreement across the whole 20 years. The median NWEU‐noUK results are higher (380–3770 kt a −1 ) than the UNFCCC estimates but the overall trend agreement is good. It is possible that in the inversion estimates some of the actual UK emissions are incorrectly assigned to a grid box outside of the UK domain ( ) and highlights the challenge of estimating emissions from just one site. A similar site, or sites, on the east coast of the United Kingdom would enable a much clearer distinction between UK and non‐UK sources. This may partially explain the rise in the NWEU‐noUK total in 1991–1993 and the corresponding dip in the UK total in the same years. It is also notable that the uncertainty ranges for CH 4 are significantly larger than those for N 2 O reflecting the larger baseline noise for CH 4 . The inversion results are consistent with the initial and crude analysis of the observations ( ), i.e., a relatively flat UK CH 4 emission trend and a declining emission trend for UK N 2 O. The comparison in the trend in emissions for the United Kingdom for CH 4 and N 2 O are strikingly different. However, for both gases the inversion methodology was identical. Also because the agreement with the independent NOAA observational record for both gases at Mace Head has shown strong consistency over the entire period, it is unlikely that the comparisons are significantly affected by a difference in the accuracy of the observations. Other possible explanations could be a significant difference in their respective emission distributions or the relative impact of emission intermittency. However, both gases are primarily released from diffuse sources, e.g., agriculture, landfill. The intermittency of significant N 2 O emissions following fertilizer application will certainly impact on the observations and hence the inversion results and it is difficult to directly quantify this affect. The long (3 year) inversion periods have been chosen to minimize this impact. The UK UNFCCC CH 4 estimates show a significant decline (2364 kt) between 1990 and 2003. This is dominated by a reduction of emissions from solid waste disposal on land (landfill) of 1320 kt (waste sector) and from fugitive emissions from solid fuel (coal mining) of 610 kt (energy sector). These two source categories account for 82% of the reduction in the reported emissions. The reduction in the median UK CH 4 inversion estimates between 1990 and 2003 amount to 780 kt, albeit with significant uncertainty, a third of the reduction declared to the UNFCCC. Therefore the difference in the reduction in UK CH 4 emissions between the two methods is 1590 kt. It is important to understand the reason for this mismatch in the UK CH 4 estimates. Could a significant proportion (66%) of the reported emission reduction in the UK landfill and coal mining have already been achieved by 1990? This would fit with the inversion estimates. Or could the reduction in the emissions from landfill and coal mining have been partially compensated for by an increase in a different unreported source(s)? This is unlikely because these significant emissions would still have to be present today and would not fit with the present‐day good match between the two emission estimates. Was the reduction in landfill emissions not achieved? This could be either that the landfill emission reduction methods were not as effective or that the landfill were not emitting as much as estimated in the early 1990s. The former would imply that the current inventory is still underreporting which is not supported by the inversion estimates. The latter explanation would be more consistent with the inversion results and support the argument that pre‐1990 emission reductions in waste/coal were more effective than estimated in the inventory. The magnitude of the difference between the inventory and the inversion estimates is more than twice the reduction reported for coal mining alone hence it is unlikely that this is the main reason for the difference although it could be a significant contributing factor if it was in error. Another possibility is that the UK CH 4 inversion estimates and more importantly the emission trend is significantly in error. However, the same methodology was applied equally to CH 4 and to N 2 O so it is unlikely that only one of the trends is correct. The meteorology used was consistent throughout the time period so this is unlikely to be the cause of an error in the trend. The measurement instrument was changed in February 1994 but the difference between the inventory and inversion results were at their peak in 1993–1995 and remained very significant (outside 75th percentile range) until 2000 and so this is unlikely to be a significant cause for the mismatch. Other inversion estimates for the United Kingdom for 2001 [ ] show higher UK emissions (4200 kt a −1 ) than found in this study. However, more recent work by this group [ ] revised their emissions for the United Kingdom down to a value more consistent with both this study and the current inventory value for 2001. All of these estimates were performed using data from just one measurement station on the west coast of Ireland. The inversion estimates would be improved if more stations, each making comparable quality observations, were included in the analysis. Not only would this add more data, but crucially, enable a better distinction between the United Kingdom and Continental European emissions, especially if some of the additional sites were on the east coast of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately additional observations at other stations in Europe were only started, at the earliest, in the late 1990s. Including other stations midway through the analysis period would undermine the consistent approach used throughout the time series in this study, but would be a worthy exercise to undertake in future work. Conclusions This paper describes a method for estimating the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere baseline mixing ratio from observations recorded at the remote Mace Head, Ireland measurement station. The baseline trends of CH 4 and N 2 O from 1989 until 2009 are presented. They show that the abundance of N 2 O has consistently increased in the atmosphere with an average growth of 0.7 ppb a −1 . The CH 4 mixing ratio has risen overall and an average growth rate of 3.9 ppb a −1 is reported. However, with both gases there is significant year‐to‐year variability in the growth rates, with CH 4 having seen several periods of negative growth. Both gases have significant seasonal cycles with sharp summer minima and broad spring maxima. The CH 4 minimum and maximum occur a month earlier than that seen in the N 2 O record. An inversion method is described that is shown to accurately reproduce regional emission totals given, so‐called, modeled pseudo observations, even when an independent meteorology is used. Annual inversion emission estimates for the United Kingdom and NWEU (United Kingdom removed) for CH 4 and N 2 O are presented for each year, 1990–2007, using, where available, two different meteorological data sets. The comparison between the estimates derived using both meteorologies is good and the results using UKMO consistently fall within the estimated uncertainty ranges of the ERAI results. The inversion results have been compared to the country values reported to the UNFCCC process. The results indicate reasonable agreement for the United Kingdom for N 2 O over the entire period. The median inversion estimates are on average 22% lower than the inventory estimates. For CH 4 for the United Kingdom the median NAME inversion estimates show a decline of 24% in emissions from the 3 year period 1990–1992 to the period 2005–2007, compared to a drop of over 50% in the reported inventory values. The uncertainties in both methods are significant but the different trends are striking. The agreement in the trend for NW Europe (United Kingdom removed) for both gases is reasonable, on average the inversion results for N 2 O are 25% lower than inventory estimates and for CH 4 21% higher. The drop in the UK CH 4 inventory values is reported to be dominated by a reduction in landfill and, to a lesser extent, coal mine emissions. The UK CH 4 estimates agree, within the 25th–75th percentile model uncertainties, from 2000 onward. The agreement of the N 2 O estimates and the later agreement of the CH 4 estimates points to the inversion methodology being capable of estimating UK emissions. It would suggest that the landfill and maybe the coal mine emissions in the early 1990s may have been overestimated in the reported inventory values. This is particularly relevant as 1990 is used as the base year on which to calculate UK reductions in emissions to comply with the UK Kyoto commitments, set at 12.5% within the compliance period 2008–2012. If the median UK inversion estimates for 1990 and 2007 for N 2 O and CH 4 are used to replace the inventory values in calculating the total GHG reduction in emissions from 1990 then the United Kingdom has achieved a drop of 14.3% by 2007 compared to the reported value of 17.3%. Therefore the United Kingdom would still have complied with its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol but, if the NAME inversion estimates are assumed, by a smaller margin.

Typically, the SSA particles contain ∼55% of Cl, 30% of Na, 8% of sulphates, and other components in smaller fractions. SSA particles may also be enriched with organic material [ ; ; ; ]. SSA affects the Earth radiation budget, atmospheric chemistry, cloud processes, and climate [ ; ]. The mass concentration of SSA and its associated light scattering effects are not generally high in comparison with those of the anthropogenic aerosols in heavily polluted areas (with an exception of storm episodes where large amounts of coarse SSA are produced). However, the oceans cover 70% of the Earth whereas the highest concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols are confined to a relatively small part of the world. Therefore, the global annual impacts of anthropogenic and sea salt aerosols on the radiation budget are similar [ ; ]. The effect of SSA is particularly important in the Southern Hemisphere where SSA is the major particulate compound. Two other major aerosol sources there are biomass burning and DMS oxidation, which, however, contribute only marginally to the global atmospheric aerosol mass [ ; ; ]. Sea salt particles are hygroscopic and, in a humid environment, mainly exist as liquid droplets (but still referred to as “particles“ throughout this paper). They are also readily activated to form cloud condensation nuclei [ ]. With increasing concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei, the cloud microphysical properties change, i.e., the available water vapor is re‐distributed over more particles, on average resulting in smaller particle sizes, which in turn changes both cloud albedo and precipitation [ ; ; ; ]. The production of very coarse sea salt aerosols (dry particle diameter D P > 20 μ m) contributes to the transfer of heat and water vapor from the ocean to the atmosphere at very high wind speeds [ ]. With regard to the atmospheric transport, SSA particles are water‐soluble with size, density, and light‐scattering properties dependent on relative humidity [e.g., ]. The primary SSA removal processes are scavenging by precipitation and dry deposition (including gravitational settling). To quantify the distribution and the effects of sea spray aerosol, accurate estimates of the SSA production, dispersion, and sinks are required. The corresponding models have to include descriptions of the main quantities governing the above processes. Over‐simplified parameterizations may be insufficient because the changing climate will alter the surface winds, water temperature, salinity, etc., and thus change the conditions of sea spray emission and atmospheric dispersion [ ]. The SSA production at the sea surface is primarily dependent on wind speed but other parameters influencing this process have been identified as well, e.g., seawater temperature and salinity, atmospheric stability, wave height and steepness [ ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ]. The wind stress at the water surface leads to formation of waves and, when the waves break, to formation of bubbles. The bubbles rise to the sea surface and, when they burst, seawater droplets are injected into the atmospheric layer adjacent to the water surface [ ]. A substantial fraction of the initially emitted particles falls back into the sea while other particles are mixed upwards due to turbulence. This bubble‐mediated SSA production mechanism is believed to be the main process responsible for sea salt production at moderate wind speeds [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. Bubbles bursting at the water surface produce two types of droplets: film drops ejected from the rim of the receding film cap when it breaks [ ] and jet drops formed from the break‐up of the vertically rising water jet from the collapsing bubble cavity [e.g., ]. The film droplets are smaller in size (mainly sub‐micron, up to hundreds per bubble), while the jet droplets (up to ten per bubble) are usually larger than 1 μ m in radius [ ]. At strong winds, the direct production of spume droplets from breaking waves becomes important [ ]. Spume droplets generally have a dry particle diameter D p larger than a few μ m, i.e., their diameter at formation is larger than 10 μ m resulting in an atmospheric life time which is so short that they have limited importance at regional and global scales. Multiple modeling studies have explored the main features of the SSA distribution over regions and the globe [e.g., ; ; ; ; ]. A major comparison of representation of aerosols in global models has been made by the AeroCom community ( ) [ ; , and references therein]. A critical analysis of the SSA modeling approaches can be also found in the major review of , hereinafter referred to as LS04. The main goals of the current study are the development and evaluation of parameterization of the SSA emission, which would include the other key factors than wind speed controlling the bubble‐mediated production, i.e., water surface temperature and salinity. The specific objectives are: (i) to develop a comprehensive and computationally efficient parameterization of the sea salt emission for particles with D p ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ m and for environmentally relevant ranges of water temperature and salinity, (ii) to implement the emission term in the dispersion model SILAM (System for Integrated modeling of Atmospheric coMposition), and (iii) to apply and evaluate the developed system at European and global scales. Therefore, the current paper is mainly limited to discussion of particles with D p < 10 μ m and on the bubble bursting process as the production term. The local effects of surf zones and very high wind speed conditions are out of the scope of the study. Basic Terms and Equations The SSA emission is commonly parameterized in terms of a source function, which describes the upward flux of sea salt particles at or near the ocean surface as a function of atmospheric and oceanic parameters. For practical purposes the effective flux is often evaluated at an effective height of 10 m above the sea surface [ ; ; ]. In general form: _placeholder_formula_ Here F is the effective particle number flux from a unit area of open water, so that is the flux density for an infinitely small range of the dry particle diameter D p [ μ m], expressed in [# μ m −1 m −2 s −1 ], U 10 is the wind speed at 10 m above the water surface [m s −1 ], T w is the water temperature [K], S w is the water salinity [relative unit]. In the general form, the emission depends on all parameters of the rhs of the equation and their effects can be inter‐connected. However, in most parameterizations the processes are separated and, for instance, the dependence on particle size is considered only for some of them. This is somewhat artificial since there is neither strong experimental evidence that any of the forcing mechanisms affects production of particles of all sizes equally, nor strong evidence that these mechanisms can be considered independently from each other. For instance, some observations suggested that both bubble and aerosol spectra vary with wind [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. It was noted [ ; ] that coarse particles can be suspended in the atmosphere longer at higher wind speed due to mechanical mixing compensating the gravitational fallout. In that case, a larger fraction of the coarse particles can reach the reference height of 10 m above the water surface and be counted as “emitted.” Finally, the experiments of demonstrated the dependence of the aerosol spectrum on water salinity and temperature. Considering these effects, the wind speed is the primary driver of the total aerosol production, whereas its impact on the particle spectrum is much smaller than that of water temperature and salinity. This impact is also smaller than the overall uncertainty of the existing SSA source functions. Therefore, in the current work the SSA production is approximated as the product of a shape function (differential density of the SSA number flux – per unit whitecap area and unit D p range), which depends only on particle size and not on any of the meteorological parameters, and several forcing terms: _placeholder_formula_ where the forcing terms correspond to effects of wind speed (through the whitecap fraction), water‐temperature, and salinity denoted as W , F TW and F SW , respectively. Throughout this paper, the particle size is characterized by its dry diameter D p . To relate the particle sizes at different ambient humidity, suggested descriptions of growth of different salt particles with increasing relative humidity, RH, but these require numerical solution of a transcendental equation. An accuracy within ∼3% from SSA observations can be also obtained from empirical relations for relative humidity 98% > RH > RH deliq , where RH deliq = ∼50% is a deliquescence relative humidity [ ; ; , ; ]: _placeholder_formula_ Here D 0,S is the diameter of a droplet formed from seawater with salinity S , D RH is the equilibrium diameter of the particle at relative humidity RH [fraction]; and ρ s and ρ 35 are the densities of a droplet at salinity S and 35‰, respectively. Since ρ s deviates from ρ 35 by less than 1%, this term is usually omitted. For SSA, a simple relation D p = 0.5 D 80% is valid with < 5% error. is used hereinafter for conversion between the different humidity and salinity values reported by different authors, but with two amendments. First, it is applicable up to RH crit ∼0.98 whereas numerical schemes and parameterizations of atmospheric models allow RH > 1 in cloudy conditions. Therefore, for RH > 0.98, we replaced the formula with its linear extrapolation starting from RH = 0.98. The values of RH > 1.03 are considered erroneous and replaced with RH = 1.03. Second, for RH < RH deliq the dry particle diameter is used. Most formulations for wind‐forcing are expressed in terms of the fraction of the water area covered by white caps (whitecap fraction, W ). ] suggested an empirical power law fit for W as a function of the wind speed at 10 m above the surface U 10 : _placeholder_formula_ Other formulations for W have been published in the literature, which can diverge from by up to an order of magnitude [ ; ; ; ; , and references therein] but is the most widely used for modeling. Formulations for the shape function, dF 0 / dD p vary widely as well. One of the most used functions was suggested by , which, in terms of D p , reads as: _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in μ m. This shape function was obtained from laboratory experiments for the production of SSA within the D p size range from 0.8 μ m to 8 μ m. Numerous other schemes have been developed apart from [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , and references therein]. Some of them utilize directly the Monahan function and extrapolate it to larger and/or smaller particles [e.g., ; ; ; ], others attribute different mechanisms of SSA production to different parts of the spectrum, so that a resulting curve becomes a sum of two or more (lognormal) distributions [e.g., ; ]; several approaches use polynomial fits and their combinations with other functions [e.g., ; ; ], etc. Comparison of some of these source functions [ ; ; ; ] shows that, within the ranges for which the schemes were derived, their predictions are within one order of magnitude. It was noted however, that extrapolation significantly outside the original parameter ranges can lead to unpredictable results. Thus, according to , the extrapolated Monahan parameterization over‐states the production of particles with D p < 0.1 μ m, but under‐estimates the flux for 0.1 μ m < D p < 1 μ m. It also underestimates the flux for very large particles ( D p > 10 μ m), for which the formulations of can be used instead. A significant weakness of most of the currently used parameterizations is that they depend only on wind speed and do not include any effects of water temperature and salinity. However, as shown by , the variation of these parameters can change the production flux in certain size ranges by more than an order of magnitude. Recent work of has also demonstrated the importance of the sea surface temperature. Modeling Tools and Input Data The Modeling System SILAM The modeling tool used in this study for the evaluation of the new parameterization, as well as for the global and regional simulations is the System for Integrated modeling of Atmospheric coMposition SILAM [ , ]. Its dynamic core currently includes both Eulerian and Lagrangian advection‐diffusion formulations. The Eulerian core used in the current study is based on the transport scheme of , , which incorporates the horizontal diffusion term and is combined with the extended resistance analogy of for vertical diffusion. The removal processes are described via dry and wet deposition. Depending on the particle size, mechanisms of dry deposition vary from the primarily turbulent diffusion driven removal of fine aerosols to the primarily gravitational settling of coarse particles [ ; ]. The SILAM wet deposition parameterization [ ; ; ; ] is based on direct observations performed for moderately hydrophobic aerosols (not sea salt, however). It distinguishes between sub‐ and in‐cloud scavenging by both rain and snow. The particle size dependence of the impaction scavenging is taken into account by increasing the scavenging rate for super‐micron particles in relation to their settling velocity. The system includes a meteorological pre‐processor for diagnosing the basic features of the boundary layer and the free troposphere from the meteorological fields provided by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models [ ]. Physical‐chemical transformation modules of SILAM include several tropospheric chemistry schemes, basic aerosol dynamics, and radioactive decay processes. The system accepts flexible definition of the particle size spectrum, which can be defined for each specific run depending on the application. In the current study, SILAM was used only as a hosting system for the SSA source term. Therefore, all other emission sources and all transformation modules were disabled leaving only transport and deposition modules active. The simulations were performed for the region covering Europe and Northern Atlantic for May–October 2003, full years 2000, 2007, 2009 and 2010, and for the whole globe for the full years 2001 and 2008. The choice of the years was somewhat arbitrary but we emphasized the recent years because of better quality of the meteorological data and more abundant observational data. The overall time span starting from 2000 covered the 11‐year the solar cycle, which might otherwise introduce a bias in a shorter‐period study. The resolution of the regional runs was 30 km while the global simulations were made with 1 degree grid spacing. The vertical grid consists of 9 unevenly spaced layers, with the lowest layer being 50 m thick and the ninth one reaching up to about 9 km above the surface. As shown by , this vertical structure is sufficient for accurate representation of the relevant concentration profiles and vertical fluxes. All simulations were made with a 15 min internal time step while the model results are provided as 1‐h averages. The computations were made with spin‐up of one week for regional and one month for global scales. The regional simulations were run with zero boundary conditions but over a sufficiently large domain so that the observational sites were more than 200 km from the border. The actual water temperature used in the model runs for the global simulations was obtained from the ECMWF analyses whereas the European model runs were made with seasonally averaged data with spatial resolution of 1°. Salinities were fixed at 33‰ for the oceans, at 9‰ for the Baltic Sea and at 0‰ for the fresh‐water basins. For the long‐term simulations, we used four bins with the D p ranges 0.01–0.1 μ m, 0.1–1 μ m, 1–2.5 μ m, and 2.5–10 μ m. Inside each range, the fluxes are integrated, and the volume‐weighted mean diameter of the particles is taken. This representation corresponds to the routine in situ observations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , which simplifies the model‐measurement comparison. The number of ranges, together with the volume‐weighted averaging and uneven distribution over the size ranges, provides accuracy better than ∼10% for both total mass and aerosol optical depth (AOD) [ ]. For the detailed spectrum evaluation, 8 months in 2009 and 2010 were computed with high spectral resolution (18 bins over 0.01–10 μ m range). For comparison with Na + observations in PM 2.5 and PM 10 , the Na + fraction in SSA mass was assumed to be 30% and the D p size ranges 0.01–2.5 μ m and 0.01–10 μ m were summed‐up, respectively. The computations of the AOD of the atmospheric vertical column are based on Mie theory [ ], which implementation in SILAM is described by . The refractive indices for the Mie computations are taken from the OPAC database [ ], whereas the size of the particles for the ambient relative humidity was computed using the . Meteorological information and necessary geophysical and land cover maps are taken from the FMI‐HIRLAM and ECMWF meteorological models. Initial Formulations and Input Data The SSA source function development is based on the parameterization of (further referred to as M86), equations (4), (5) , the data of (further referred to as M03), and the results of the SEAS campaign [ ] ( ). The formulation does not cover the size range D p < 0.8 μ m, which has long atmospheric lifetime and large contribution to the SSA surface area and thus to optical thickness ( ). This range therefore is the most important one for regional and global scales and for interactions with atmospheric chemistry and climate. The parameterization also does not include the particle flux dependence on water temperature and salinity. The actual water temperature during the experiment is not mentioned in the paper but as the experiment was performed in the laboratory, a typical room temperature of about 20°C can be assumed. The experiments were made in a small tank with artificial seawater with salinities of 0‰, 9‰ and 33‰ and water temperatures of −2°C, 5°C, 15°C, and 25°C. Bubbles were generated by an aerator and the SSA particles were produced when the bubbles burst at the surface. Particle size distributions in the size range from 20 nm to 3 μ m were measured in the headspace, which was first freed from particles by flushing the tank with the filtered air. Based on these observations, Mårtensson et al. suggested a parameterization, which, however, we found to be very sensitive to details of the numerical implementation. The coefficients of the suggested 6th order polynomial fits vary by over 15 orders of magnitude resulting in extremely fast fluctuations of the fit. In particular, no changes appeared possible in the definition of the size bins used in that work: different spectrum definitions appeared to change the fluxes. Therefore, below we develop the new parameterization using only the observations. The SEAS data set is the only one that has observations for particles smaller than 0.02 μ m. However, it was a field experiment conducted near the surf zone and thus influenced by local processes, which are beyond the scope of the current study. Since these processes mainly influence the coarser particles, we used the SEAS data only for particles smaller than 0.02 μ m. The water temperature and salinity were not explicitly reported but mentioned that they were similar to those of the reference values (25°C and 33‰). Suggested SSA Production Term In the current section, we provide a condensed description of the new SSA source term. More detailed discussion of the formulas, their connections to physical processes and relations to other models is given in . Adaptation of the Formulations to the Data The new shape function was obtained by modifying the equation (5) in order to fit the observations extracted from the paper for T w = 25°C and S = 0.033 (33‰) and the SEAS data for D p < 0.02 μ m. The resulting curve was extrapolated from 8 to 10 μ m to cover the whole target range 0.01–10 μ m. The advantages of the shape as a starting point are: (i) it was justified by (though the reasoning was later criticized by ), (ii) it is a widely used function, which simplifies the comparison with other models, (iii) it is monotonous, smooth, and requires only modest adjustments to fit into the and SEAS data. The only significant correction refers to sub‐0.1 μ m particles, for which an additional term has to be introduced to reduce the production. The resulting shape function for particles with D p [ μ m] ranging from 0.01 to 10 μ m reads as: _placeholder_formula_ The function is presented in together with the original and extrapolated formulations (5), the data and the SEAS shape function. Compared to the original formula (5), the ratio of exponents in reduces the production flux for particles smaller than ∼0.1 μ m while the adjusted coefficients in the other terms eliminate the under‐estimation of the flux in the 0.1–1 μ m range and maintain the overall scale. The corresponding mass and particle surface fluxes are presented in . Effects of Water Temperature and Salinity The shape function describes the SSA number flux at the reference temperature of 25°C and at the reference salinity of 33 ‰. Below, we compute the correction factors F TW , F SW from as functions of two variables – temperature/salinity and particle size. Effect of Water Temperature For water temperatures other than 25°C, the correction functions F Tw were derived by dividing the observed fluxes at T w = 15°C, 5°C and −2°C by the fluxes at 25°C. shows that the ratios of the production fluxes at these three temperatures to the flux at T w = 25°C are smooth and monotonically decreasing with increasing particle size. The apparent deviations from the otherwise good power law fit are around D p ∼ 0.1–0.2 μ m and D p ∼ 2 μ m where a few outliers appear in some correction functions (shown with lighter colors). These are related to non‐monotonicity of the particle size distributions measured by at different temperatures. refer to maxima in the size spectra at these diameters as modes, but do not present any explanation for the occurrence of these modes. Therefore, at this stage it looks premature to build parameterizations taking them into account. In the following we disregard these outliers and approximate the data with the power law functions ( ): _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in [ μ m]. Due to monotonicity of the dependencies with regard to water temperature, the correction factors for other temperatures can be obtained by interpolation. Lacking information to justify more complicated interpolations, we suggest the use of linear functions. There are no data for extrapolation outside the observed range for particles larger than 6–7 μ m and smaller than 0.02 μ m. However, for regional and large‐scale applications, a sea‐spray source function for dry diameters from 0.01 μ m up to at least 10 μ m is needed. Therefore, and by lack of any evidence of other extrapolations, the corrections were used for the sea‐spray particles with dry diameters up to 10 μ m. However, the uncertainty in the extrapolated production flux is anticipated to be large. Effect of Salinity The effect of salinity is evaluated following the same procedure as for the temperature correction. The salinity of 33‰ is taken as the reference and for other salinities the correction functions F Sw are derived using the ratios of the fluxes for 9.2‰ (e.g., Baltic Sea) and 0‰ (“fresh” water) to that at 33‰ (oceanic conditions). Fitting of these ratios to power law functions ( ) results in: _placeholder_formula_ where D p is in [ μ m]. There is no observational data for intermediate salinities but the trend is clear and monotonic: lower salinity leads to lower SSA production. Therefore we again suggest linear interpolation between these two functions. The functions apply only to the size range for which the measurements are available but we used them for D p up to 10 μ m. Similar to the temperature correction, the uncertainty of the extrapolation is anticipated to be large but its impact is limited because the contribution of coarse particles to the flux from low‐saline and fresh water is small ( ). Similar to F Tw , the fresh‐water ratio shows inhomogeneity at D p ∼ 0.1 μ m. However, since it again has no clear explanation, we still use the single fit over the whole D p range. For the applications, one has to keep in mind an ambiguity connected with the SSA production from fresh water. In the experiment, the “fresh” water was distilled water, which has much lower concentrations of dissolved matter, such as various salts and organic matter, than natural fresh water. Therefore, in the experiment, a large fraction of “fresh” water particles would evaporate completely before reaching the particle sampler while in natural water bodies the residual particles would remain. However, since there is no other information available, we used the data to obtain but would expect the flux from actual fresh‐water bodies to be somewhat larger than the one suggested by the parameterization. Evaluation of the SSA Emission Module Via SILAM CTM Calculations The new SSA production parameterization closely follows the shape function and data over most of their ranges of applicability ( ). For the finest particles, the SEAS shape is approached. The difference between the curves is smaller than the uncertainty of the functions themselves (e.g., three standard deviations of the data, p = 0.001), except for D p > 1 μ m, where the parameterizations differ by more than an order of magnitude and where the new parameterization follows the shape. Therefore the outcome of the existing evaluations of the original schemes ( , and SEAS) is applicable to the current one within the relevant particle size ranges and environmental conditions. In particular, was evaluated against direct flux measurements by and . The scheme was used in numerous studies, which included comparison of dispersion model results with observed concentrations [e.g., ; , chap. 4.1; ; ]. The effect of water temperature on the emission flux has been confirmed by eddy covariance measurements at Mace Head by and . Finally, used GCM GISS for comparison of the , and SEAS schemes and evaluation of their fluxes and particle size spectra. They showed that the SEAS scheme is closer to the observed spectra for sub‐0.1 μ m than other schemes but shows much too high contribution of coarse particles ( D p > 1 μ m). The parameterization was somewhat better in 0.1–1 μ m range. As seen from , the current parameterization approaches the corresponding schemes at each of these ranges. Since this comparison was made using different transport and meteo model than those of the current study, it was repeated following the same procedure as that of . Below, we concentrate on comparison of the SILAM model predictions obtained using the SSA parameterizations – with observations. Observations of sea salt were obtained from five sources: (i) a few independent campaigns that provided aerosol size distributions in the marine boundary layer [ ; ; ]; (ii) several sites of the EMEP network (Co‐operative Programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long‐range transmission of air pollutants in Europe, ) that perform regular analysis of Na + concentration in total PM; (iii) several EMEP stations that perform ion analysis of precipitation including Na + ; (iv) the satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, which can be considered representative for sea salt in remote regions (excluding areas with high influence of other aerosols); (v) the near‐surface concentrations for global SILAM evaluation were taken from the paper of and references therein. These data sets are complementary. Indeed, the comparison with size distributions shows the system's ability to treat particles of different sizes but, e.g., the absolute concentration may not be representative due to the small amount of data obtained from a limited area. The mass concentrations of Na + in aerosol are measured near the surface and mainly reflect the amount of coarse‐fraction SSA particles (the main SSA mass flux is within the size range 0.5–5 μ m – ). The scavenging with precipitation washes out the whole atmospheric column. Therefore, the Na + concentration in precipitation provides an insight into the column‐integrated mass of SSA, which in turn is directly linked to the mass production and removal terms. Finally, AOD is proportional to the total particle area, for which the production peaks at the sub‐micron size range ( ). The model‐predicted sea salt concentrations are affected by a large number of processes including SSA production, transport, and removal from the atmosphere. Inaccuracies of the transport model or precipitation pattern can thus be misinterpreted as errors in the production term or the errors can compensate each other. However, the above mentioned independent and mutually complementary types of measurements with substantially different features and observed quantities might reduce the chance of such flukes. Evaluation of the Sea‐Salt Size Distribution The SSA number size distributions produced by the SILAM run for 2009–2010 with high spectral resolution is compared with the data from a cruise at the North‐East Atlantic (NEAT) published by ] ‐ . The set of measurements represents a typical Northeast Atlantic SSA number size distribution for end‐1980s. The SILAM spectrum‐resolving computations were made for November 2009 and, for comparison, July 2010, thus meeting the NEAT season (late autumn) but not the year. In the current parameterization the spectrum depends on water surface temperature and salinity but not on wind speed or any other dynamic meteorological parameter. The selection of different years then allows for explicit verification of this assumption. Indeed, averaging over the same season ensures that the water temperature and salinity are similar, whereas the different years eliminate any apparent connection to the short‐term weather phenomena. Comparison of absolute levels of the concentrations indicates the stability of the frequency distribution of wind speed from year to year. As seen from , the key features of the NEAT size distribution are reproduced by the model: the absolute peak of number concentrations at 20–30 nm (if the nucleation‐produced aerosol with D p < ∼0.01 μ m is excluded – see ), decreasing contribution of coarser particles, and similar absolute concentrations over the part of accumulation mode 0.1–1 μ m. The only missing component refers to strong contribution of the local production of coarse aerosols ( D p > ∼2 μ m), which are under‐estimated. Slight under‐estimation of the fine‐particle concentrations may indicate too strong removal of sub‐micron particles in the model or the impact of aerosol processes. The shape of the fine‐particle range of the spectrum has to be clarified further with aerosol dynamic processes taken into account – nucleation in the clean marine atmosphere and coagulation sink for both newly nucleated particles and small sea salt aerosols. The slight difference between the spectra for November and July shows the impact of seasonal change. Stronger winds in November resulted in higher production of all particles (as well as their deposition), whereas colder temperatures suppressed production of coarse aerosols. As a result, the fine‐particle concentration is higher in winter by a few tens of %, whereas the load of the coarse ones stayed the same. Comparison for the spectra over different parts of the globe is shown in . There, four SILAM ranges are presented via their volume‐weighted mean D p . The SSA spectra observed from the cruises in open sea (panels in the upper two rows of the ) are reproduced well, whereas the coarse fraction is somewhat under‐estimated near the coast (lower two rows). The effect is particularly strong in Cape Grim, which spectrum is very heavily dominated by coarse fraction – much more than in other data sets. These are probably originated from local surf‐zone. Evaluation of the Bulk SSA Mass Concentrations Near the Surface The bulk SSA mass concentrations computed with SILAM for 2000 and 2007 were compared with in situ data measured at EMEP stations for the same years. Computed and measured annual mean Na + concentrations at all available EMEP stations (7 for 2000 and 22 for 2007) are presented as a scatterplot in . A similar scatterplot for the wet deposition is shown in . For the comparison the mass fraction of Na in SSA dry mass was assumed to be 30%. The spatial distributions of several key statistical characteristics can be found in the , for the same two years. The scatterplots in and the maps of the scores in the show that the predicted annual‐mean SSA near‐surface concentrations are reproduced very well, while the mean wet deposition is underestimated by about a factor of 3. The sites with wet deposition > 1 mg Na m −2 day −1 are reproduced poorly whereas the agreement for lower annual deposition is within a factor of ∼2. The correlations between the modeled and measured daily concentrations vary widely with the correlation coefficients exceeding 0.5 for several sites ( and ). Note that such correlation coefficient is already approaching the maximum reachable value (about 0.7) between the daily time series [see ]. The comparison of wet deposition time series is complicated due to very high variability of this variable and its dependence on quality of the input precipitation fields. In particular, the uncertainty of its statistics is always larger than a factor of two. As a result the model scores vary strongly between the stations and regions (see ). However, the tendency toward underestimation is visible for practically all stations for both years (but stronger for 2000). The underestimation largely originates from only partly reproduced deposition peaks reported by the observations (see example in for Southern Norway in 2000), which results in too small short‐term dynamic range of predicted wet deposition (up to 0.1 g Na + m −2 day −1 instead of observed maximum of almost 1 g Na + m −2 day −1 ). The underestimation of the peaks can have several reasons: (i) omission of the surf zone SSA emission and the spume‐drop production mechanism, (ii) missing wind gustiness, (iii) SILAM scavenging parameterization may be too conservative for highly hygroscopic aerosols, (iv) under‐estimated precipitation amount by the HIRLAM model in 2000 ( and Figure A3). Importantly, the appearance of the precipitation events is well reproduced by the NWP models ( ), i.e., the input information on occurrence of wet deposition episodes is available. The absolute amount of precipitation, however, has little effect on the wet deposition evaluation because even quite small rain removes the bulk of the SSA mass from the column (as these particles are the highly soluble and coarse). Indeed, the improvement in the precipitation data from 2000 (under‐estimated, Figure A3) to 2007 (mostly unbiased, Figure A6) somewhat reduced the wet deposition under‐estimation but did not eliminate it completely ( , Figures A2 and A5). To evaluate the impact of possibly too conservative SILAM scavenging parameterization, a sensitivity model run over 2007 was arranged with the scavenging rate increased 100‐fold. The resulting increase of total monthly wet deposition was from 10 to 15% in winter up to 20% in summer. Therefore, the limitations of the precipitation information and conservative SILAM scavenging parameterization are contributing but clearly not the main limiting factors, leaving the omitted contribution of the spume‐drop production, wind gustiness and the surf zone emission as the primary reasons for the under‐estimation. Considering the seasonal variations, the model showed a close match of both concentrations and wet deposition during summer but a pronounced underestimation during winter time ( ). The latter is expected because the particles with D p > 10 μ m are not considered in this study – but they are still generated and can be suspended in air during winter storms, thus contributing to the total mass (also inland). The generation of such large particles occurs not only via the bubble‐mediated mechanism considered here but also by direct tearing off the spume droplets from the wave tops at the wind speeds exceeding ∼9 ms −1 [ ; ; ]. Also, during the wintertime, the gustiness over the sea surface increases [ ] resulting in enhanced SSA production. Neglecting these processes in the present simulations can lead to significant underestimation of the SSA mass in winter, especially at the near‐coast observation sites. Evaluation of the near‐surface concentrations in different parts of the globe was based on the data extracted from the paper of ‐ . The observational plots were taken “as‐is,” whereas the SILAM results were summed up to D a < 10 μ m. This range probably deviates from the observations [ ], which typically cover particles with <10 μ m ambient‐humidity size, i.e., D p < ∼6 μ m. As follows from , such extension adds about 10–20% to the SSA mass production, which is within the uncertainty of the estimates. Increase of the concentrations is even lower due to high deposition rates of particles with actual diameter exceeding 10 μ m. As seen from , the model is capable of reproducing the range of concentrations from ∼1 μ g SSA m −3 at Alert and Palmer sites, up to 20–30 SSA μ g m −3 at Barbados and Bermuda, with intermediate levels shown at e.g., Cheju and Miami. A systematic underestimation is shown for Cape Grim, which has large fraction of coarse aerosols of presumably local origin. However, if compared with the Cape Grim observational results presented by , the agreement is substantially better ( , first row, third panel). The dissimilarity between the measurements can be due to the different years, instruments, and actual positioning of the inlets used for the measurement campaigns, Both sources mention PM 10 as the analyzed quantity. The seasonality is mostly dependent on the input wind speed, which seem to be reproduced at most of the sites. Large problems are seen only at Mace Head and Helmaey, i.e., in the Northern Atlantic, where winter maxima are not captured – similar to the above EMEP‐based comparison. In comparison with results of for individual schemes ( , , SEAS), the current model is in much better agreement at the tropical sites and shows similar performance in other parts of the globe. As shown in the sensitivity tests in , the eliminated underestimation of SSA in tropics is largely attributed to actual SST included in the new parameterization. Evaluation of SSA‐Induced AOD The global distribution of the SSA contribution to the AOD was computed with SILAM for 2001 and 2008 and compared with AOD provided by the MODIS instruments onboard the NASA satellites Aqua and Terra (Collection 5: for level‐2 data , for averaged values ) ( ). The comparison required pre‐processing of both MODIS data and SILAM output. First, the cloud contamination of the MODIS level‐2 data [ ; ] was reduced by removing pixels with AOD > 1 (see for more sophisticated approach). Then the frames were projected to the SILAM grid, aggregated for each hour, and the AOD observations falling into the same SILAM grid cells were averaged. Second, for each hour the SILAM output has been picked only for the grid cells where the MODIS information is available. These two steps ensured the maximum possible co‐location of the observations and model results both in space and in time. Co‐locating the data sets, however, is not enough: the MODIS AOD includes the contribution of aerosols of all types and origin, while the SILAM computations include only SSA. Hence the comparison was restricted to the areas where the SSA load is dominant, i.e., where the AOD is least influenced by non‐sea‐salt aerosols. These are the oceanic regions at the midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, the central part of the North Atlantic and the North‐Eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. These areas are encircled in . The comparison of the annual‐mean co‐located SILAM and MODIS AOD patterns shows that in the indicated SSA‐dominated regions their difference from each other is within 20–40% of the observed values (example in for 2001). In particular, a high‐SSA pattern in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude belt of 40S‐60S) is well captured: high AOD is predicted at the same latitudes, and its mean level inside the belt is within 20–30% of the observed values. The observed MODIS AOD reaches up to 0.2, with a weak and very wide peak around 60S. Likewise, SILAM predicts AOD close to 0.2 over the same region. Consideration of the AOD maps in and histograms in shows that the regions least affected by the contribution from terrestrial aerosol sources are the Southern and Northern Pacific Ocean. There, the MODIS and SILAM AOD histograms are very similar and the mean‐AOD difference is less than 2%. The difference between the two considered years does not exceed 10–15% in any specific histogram range (not shown). The impact of non‐SS aerosol on the AOD over the Northern Atlantic and parts of the Southern Atlantic and the Indian Oceans is noticeable from the shift of the predicted SSA‐only histograms to the lower AOD values as compared to MODIS. A specific source of uncertainty of the visible‐range optical instruments is that they cannot retrieve AOD through dense clouds and tend to over‐estimate the AOD at the edge of cloudy areas [ ; ]. The latter can be reduced but missing areas had to be excluded from the comparison. It is illustrated in where the areas of high SSA concentrations predicted by SILAM correlate strongly with the missing‐data parts of the MODIS frames. The reason is the correlation of the SSA emission with storms and cyclones accompanied with dense clouds. To quantify the effect, we compared the SILAM AOD histograms with and without MODIS‐based screening ( , first panel). As one can see, the mean regional AOD without MODIS‐based screening is higher by almost 20% than the value obtained from the co‐located data. Also, the fraction of cases of each specific AOD range recorded by MODIS is not uniform over the histogram but rather demonstrates a strong anti‐correlation with AOD: it falls from about 2% for low‐AOD cases to about 1% for AOD ∼ 0.3. Despite the difficulty with high‐AOD regions, the comparison of predicted and observed AOD in the cloud‐free areas (i.e., largely outside the high‐SSA zones) still provides sufficient amount of information for the model evaluation. But for studies solely based on the satellite AOD data, especially averaged over long time periods, the missing high‐SSA data may lead to significant bias toward smaller AOD. Apart from the histogram and annual maps analyses, a time‐resolving comparison of AODs was performed for all four regions marked in to highlight the model ability to reproduce the temporal dynamics of the SSA load (driven by wind rather than slowly varying water temperature). In agreement with the histograms in , both SILAM and MODIS data were centered around the AOD ∼0.07–0.1. For the Southern Pacific over 90% of the predictions are within the factor of 2 from the observations. The other regions show both somewhat worse correlation of the observed and predicted episodes and, where the non‐SSA impact is significant, systematic low bias (Atlantic and part of Indian Ocean). The strongest impact of non‐SS aerosols is in Northern Atlantic where the under‐estimation reaches ∼40% (also seen in ). Discussion Small Particles Over Sea The current SSA source function is derived for the SSA particles with D p between 0.01 and 10 μ m and its shape function for the number flux peaks at D p about 0.03 μ m. However, the suggested shape function falls toward 0.01 μ m somewhat faster than that of SEAS ( ). There are no direct observations of SSA below 0.01 μ m but recent high‐resolution general‐aerosol measurements in the marine boundary layer suggest that the main origin of smaller particles is nucleation [ ]. The suggested shape function takes it into account by reducing the production flux toward 0.01 μ m but the uncertainty is evidently large. For the temperature and salinity correction factors, the data set seems to suggest some leveling of the trends or at least an increase of uncertainty for 0.02–0.03 μ m particles ( ), whereas the limited number of observations around 0.02 μ m is not sufficient for quantitative analysis. Therefore, the extrapolation of the temperature and salinity corrections to D p < 0.02 μ m involves large uncertainties. A source of small non‐SSA particles, which can affect the AOD observations, is the DMS emission followed by oxidation and generation of sulphate aerosol in the free troposphere (FT) [ ; ]. This contribution is substantial over biologically active areas but has strong seasonality: it is practically negligible in winter while in summer up to 50% of cloud condensation nuclei can originate from DMS. At annual averaging, the DMS contribution to aerosols over open‐ocean areas is likely to stay within 10–30% of the total number concentrations. Since the DMS‐originating particles are formed by nucleation and grow up to CCN size ( D p ∼0.1 μ m), they will contribute to the corresponding spectrum ranges (however, the details of the spectrum modification are very uncertain). This addition to the SILAM‐predicted fields may result in some over‐estimation of AOD over the Southern Pacific but it also partly explains the under‐estimation over other regions ( ). Influence of Sea Surface Temperature The production term strongly depends on the sea surface temperature T w . As seen from the correction functions and , the effect of T w differs for different particle sizes, which can originate from the differences between the production mechanisms [ ; ; ; ]. The fine particles are mainly produced from the film droplets whereas the coarse ones are mainly produced from the jet droplets. The observations suggest that these processes have different temperature dependence: with decreasing water temperatures the film‐droplet production increases while the jet‐droplet production decreases. Both trends seem to be persistent: the 15°C production is an intermediate between the ones at 25°C and near zero ( ). Qualitatively, these observations can be connected with the smooth and monotonic decrease of water viscosity with increasing temperature (the surface tension varies by < 10% for the environmentally relevant temperatures and thus cannot explain the strong dependence): the kinematic viscosity falls from 1.8·10 −6 m 2 sec −1 at 0°C down to 0.9·10 −6 m 2 sec −1 at 25°C [ ]. Based on the above observations, one can argue that the jet‐droplets production is reduced in more viscous water while the film‐droplets production is enhanced. To illustrate the impact of T w on the SILAM simulations, the global model run over 2001 was repeated with the fixed T w = 15°C. The comparison of this sensitivity run with the basic simulations with the actual T w is shown in (basic run with the actual T w , panel b: for T w = 15°C). The base run showed the highest SSA concentrations at tropical and middle latitudes (0–50 degrees north and south). In the “roaring 40s,” particularly over the Southern Hemisphere, the wind speeds are higher than in other regions and thus the enhanced SSA concentrations are due to wind speed induced production. In tropical regions, however, it is the warm water that leads to enhanced SSA production. Indeed, the results of the sensitivity run ( ) show that the SSA concentration in tropical regions is much higher if the actual water surface temperature is used. In the polar areas the effect is opposite: the concentrations are lower in the actual‐temperature run. Finally, the overall sea salt mass production over the globe is about 1.5 times larger if the actual T w is considered, with the bulk of the mass emitted in the warm regions. The simulations also show that AOD is somewhat less sensitive to T w than the surface concentrations due to the larger contribution from sub‐micron particles, for which the water temperature effect is less strong than for coarser particles mainly contributing to the SSA mass. Still, disregarding the actual T w jeopardizes the agreement with MODIS observations. Comparing the AOD histograms for the sensitivity run in (fixed T w ) with the base run results in (actual T w ), one can see that the sensitivity simulations agree much worse with the observed AOD. Thus, near the tropics (Northern Pacific region, the actual T w is higher than 15°C) the region‐mean AOD of the sensitivity run is lower than the observations by nearly a factor of 2, while near the Antarctic (the real T w is colder than 15°C) it is higher by 10–20%. Influence of Water Salinity The physical ground of the water salinity impact on the SSA spectrum and production flux is quite straightforward: lower salinity results in smaller size of the particles after water evaporates from droplets. Since coarser particles are produced in fewer numbers, the overall production decreases. However, this effect is very difficult to verify due to the small salinity variations across the World's oceans, except for local seas, such as Baltic Sea. On the other hand, its importance for the corresponding regions is evidently very large. The salinity correction functions and indicate that, for the same wind speed and water temperature, the aerosol emission at the Baltic Sea would produce approximately ten times less SSA mass per unit area than at the open ocean. As an illustration, in the SILAM simulations for 2009 and 2010 the SSA production from the Baltic Sea area was separated from that of the Atlantic Ocean. As seen from , the contribution of the Baltic Sea emission to the SSA concentration even at the sea coast is about the same as that of the Atlantic Ocean. Further inland, the Atlantic Ocean SSA fraction is clearly over 50%. Without the salinity correction, the resulting SSA concentration at the Baltic coast would be 5–10 times higher in the SILAM runs. The credibility of the above model‐based conclusions can be verified only indirectly – via model‐measurement comparison for the region. A series of campaigns in Hyytiälä (∼150 km east of the Bothnian Bay, ∼200 km north of the Gulf of Finland) and Helsinki (southern coast of Finland) provided 9 months of observations of Na + in aerosol during 2009 and 2010. The main parameter for comparison was Na + concentration in PM 10 with limited data for Na in PM 2.5 . We assumed that sodium is entirely from sea salt and summed‐up the corresponding model size bins to obtain the predictions. The comparison ( ) showed that: (i) the model captured well the concentration of Na + in aerosol, especially for the coarse fraction – the scores are similar to those for the European measurements shown in (those sites are practically not affected by Baltic Sea); (ii) there is a tendency of over‐estimation of the fine fraction; (iii) correlation of daily time series for Na + in PM 10 is quite good. The comparison also showed that the 10‐fold reduced contribution of the Baltic Sea to SSA concentrations due to its low salinity is a step in the right direction. Otherwise the model over‐estimation at Hyytiälä would be very large and strongly differing from the model scores at the European sites ( ). There can be, of course, other model parameters affecting the comparison – e.g., the scavenging parameterization or the vertical profile accuracy. However, they affect the model comparison at all sites and thus cannot cover this 10‐fold jump. The only place‐specific factor refers to the missing surf zone emission in the Helsinki archipelago, which probably caused the under‐estimation of the concentrations and low correlation at that coastal site (Helsinki is the only coastal site in the data set). The SSA Budget Predicted by the SILAM Simulations The global budget of SSA includes three terms: production flux, dry deposition, and wet deposition. Their relations strongly depend on particle size and vary from region to region, depending on meteorological conditions. They also depend on implementation of the source term – especially dry deposition is sensitive to the vertical injection profile. The suggested parameterization uses the observations made at different heights above the water surface and assumes that the corresponding parameterizations ( , , SEAS) are representative for the effective emission flux at 10 m height. However, formal application of the above source term in the model leads to mixing of the SSA over the first layer (for regional and global models, often 50–100 m thick) within one model time step. For the current simulations, the first model layer was 50 m thick and the model time step was 15 min. As shown in section 2.9 of , this mixing does not lead to excessive errors for particles with D p < 20 μ m. Being released from a near‐surface wide‐area source, a substantial fraction of the SSA mass is removed from the air shortly after the release before it gets mixed throughout the boundary layer – the process formally attributed to dry deposition (see discussion in chapter 2 of ). Consequently, the comparison of the SILAM‐predicted dry and wet deposition shows that the dry deposition flux, together with sedimentation, contributes more than 50% to the removal, being especially large for coarse particles. Wet deposition becomes dominant in all size classes only outside the source areas. This conclusion is in line with estimates of the atmospheric life time with regard to these processes summarized in Chapter 2, Table 8 of . Comparison of the SILAM‐computed SSA concentrations with those computed by, e.g., and shows that the spatial distributions are similar. In terms of the total production and loss budget, SILAM predicted a global SSA emission of 6700 Tg yr −1 in 2001 and 7400 Tg yr −1 in 2008, which is within the range of other global sea salt flux estimates: estimated it as 1000 Tg yr −1 , 11700 Tg yr −1 , 5900 Tg yr −1 , 3300 Tg yr −1 , and 6500 Tg yr −1 . More estimates can be found in the review of , who showed a range from less than 2000 Tg yr −1 up to more than 20000 Tg yr −1 . The bulk features of the SSA budget ( ) qualitatively agree with the values reported by from the computations of the GCM GISS, which was tried with all emission schemes used in the current study: , , and SEAS. The wet deposition is somewhat weaker in SILAM computations: its ratio to dry deposition varies from 3 for sub‐micron particles to 0.3 for the coarse ones. Pierce and Adams's computations showed the max value up to 10 or even more for some parameterizations. The life time of the particles was somewhat shorter in those simulations: less than a day for coarse particles and less than 3 days for fine particles. However, the budget details, especially the SSA life time, should be considered only as very crude estimates where an agreement within a factor of 2 has to be compared with an order‐of‐magnitude uncertainty in the emission fluxes if the meteorological model is changed [ ]. Large uncertainties of these details are also stressed by (their section 2.7). Corrections to the SILAM budget could originate from several sources. The current simulations do not include the contribution of the spume particles. Their size is large and atmospheric life time is short, which makes them not very important for large‐scale dispersion, but they still contribute to the mass budget. A mild increase can also be expected if the wind gustiness is taken into account. Therefore, the above budget is likely to increase if these additional sources are taken into account. The simulations for the North Atlantic show that the main contribution to the sea salt mass in the atmosphere comes from particles in the 1 μ m–10 μ m size ranges with coarse particles dominating the mass in the lower troposphere: stronger mass emission flux ( ) outweighs their shorter atmospheric lifetime. However, the sub‐micron particles dominate the number concentration – both due to the stronger production ( ) and the longer atmospheric life time. This is in agreement with other modeling studies [e.g., ; ] and reflects the generally accepted estimates that super‐micron particles contribute about 95% of aerosol mass, but only 5–10% of number concentrations in the marine boundary layer [ ; ; ]. The comparison of near‐surface mass concentrations and AOD maps reveals both similarities and differences in their spatial patterns. The mass concentration decreases with growing distance from the sea and becomes negligible at a few hundreds of kilometers inland from the coast ( ). A qualitatively similar pattern is observed in the AOD ( ) but the gradient is smaller: whereas the near‐surface concentrations ( ) drop by a factor of 10–100, the AOD decreases by less than a factor of 10. This model‐predicted effect can also be seen from the AOD observations: e.g., at the eastern coast of South America the background AOD over land at ∼500 km inland is only 6–10 times lower than that over the adjacent areas of South Atlantic at ∼500 km offshore. This is to be expected since: (i) the sub‐micron particles can be transported far inland with minor removal, (ii) the aerosol surface emission flux is the largest in the sub‐micron range ( ) and the AOD is proportional to the particle surface area, (iii) the particles that have reached the free troposphere also can be brought inland thus contributing to AOD but not to surface concentrations, (iv) once the air parcel is away from the surface source of SSA (i.e., over land), the dry deposition quickly depletes the SSA mass in the lowest layer but not the upper ones, which would take longer time to deposit. Conclusions The presented sea salt emission parameterization combines several independent approaches and data sets. It takes into account the effects of wind speed, water salinity, and water temperature. The source function is applicable to SSA particles with dry diameters between 0.01 and 10 μ m, low‐to‐moderate wind speeds, water salinity ranging from 0‰ to 33‰ and water temperature ranging from −2°C to 25°C. The parameterization has been implemented in the modeling system SILAM and the system was used to simulate the sea salt concentrations for Europe and adjacent seas for the years 2000, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2010, and for the whole globe for 2001 and 2008. Model evaluation against several campaigns, long‐term in situ (for 2000, 2007, part of 2009 and 2010) and remote‐sensing data (2001 and 2008) showed that: (i) predicted AOD is very close to the MODIS‐observed AOD for the areas where it is dominated by SSA, (ii) mass concentrations and wet deposition flux are well reproduced during the summer whereas they are under‐estimated during winter in the Northern Atlantic, whereas in the other parts of the globe the seasonality is captured better, (iii) over the globe, the SSA spectrum is reproduced well, except for the coarse part, which is somewhat under‐estimated. The under‐estimation can be mainly attributed to the omission of the spume production mechanism from the current study. For wet deposition, the conservative scavenging parameterization in SILAM system and inaccuracies of the input precipitation information also played a role. Additional uncertainty was introduced by extrapolation of the water surface temperature and salinity corrections toward the particles larger than 6 μ m. The global emission of SSA in 2001 and 2008 was estimated as 6700 and 7400 Tg yr −1 , respectively, which is in the range of estimates provided by other models (1000–20000 Tg yr −1 ). Further efforts for the scheme refinement should address the coarse particle size ranges and the spume production mechanism. Acknowledgments The study has been performed within the EU‐GEMS project.

This region extends over 400 to 600 km to the south of the Sahara desert, depending on the year [ ]. The latitudinal gradient of precipitation is thus extremely strong, with about 1 mm km −1 [ ]. The rainy season, associated to the West African Monsoon (WAM) regime, lasts from May to October at most in Sahel, with a maximum in August [ ]. The annual rainfall amount is provided by a limited number of organized convective systems occurring during the rainy season [ ]. In response to this monomodal distribution of precipitation, the Sahelian vegetation is mainly composed of annual plants, scattered shrubs, and low trees, and it exhibits a well‐marked seasonal cycle [ ]. Annuals germinate after the first rains, in June or July, and unless the plants wilted before maturity because of lack of rain, plant senescence immediately follows the fructification, largely determined by plant sensitivity to the photoperiod and matching approximately with the end of the rainy season. The herbaceous growing season is followed by a long dry season of about 8–10 months during which there is no herbaceous growth. During this period, standing herb cover decreases slowly during the first part of the dry season. This decrease accelerates from March on as the air temperature and humidity build on. This strong temporal dynamics associated with wide spatial heterogeneity raises a challenge for modeling vegetation dynamics over the Sahel belt. Furthermore, reliable rainfall maps are critical to the investigation of scientific issues such as dust emission in semiarid regions [e.g., ; ] or hydrological regimes [e.g., ]. In the semiarid region of Sahel, the most limiting factor for plant growth is the water content in the rooting zone [e.g., ; ]. In consequence, the timing of plant growth depends on the rainfall volume and distribution during the rainy season [ ]. Indeed, the extent of the seasonal growth of annual herbaceous not only depends on the annual precipitation amounts, but also on their distribution over time and space [ ]. Accordingly, precipitation data sets with high spatial and temporal resolutions are requested as main inputs in vegetation dynamical models. As an example, the Sahelian Transpiration Evaporation and Productivity (STEP) model [ ] requires daily rainfall inputs. Since the Sahel droughts in the 1970s to 1980s, the mechanisms controlling the monsoon system have been largely studied [see e.g., ; ]. Direct measurements of rainfall using gauges are performed in a network of meteorological stations, while indirect assessments of rainfall are increasingly carried out using censors onboard satellites. However, the gauge network is too sparse in many regions of the Sahel to allow precise estimates of the spatial pattern of precipitation at local (away from the gauge) to regional scales. Nowadays, the temporal distribution of precipitation can be investigated at regional to continental scales using a new generation of precipitation products combining infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) measurements [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ]. These products benefit from the good sampling rate of IR measurements from geostationary satellites and from the relatively high confidence level in rainfall estimates provided by MW sensors onboard various polar satellites. Many studies have already investigated the quality of these high spatial‐and‐temporal resolution precipitation products [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ], but few of them focused on criteria relevant to the modeling of Sahel vegetation at a regional scale, which implies working at daily to decadal time steps over several years. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the skills of rainfall products when used in vegetation modeling over the Sahel. The evaluation includes (1) the intercomparison of three selected rainfall products on criteria relevant to vegetation growth modeling which, according to the literature [e.g., ; ; ], are the timing and amounts of rainfall on a daily time step, the timing and duration of dry spells, and the spatial pattern of the rainfall fields; and (2) the test of the selected rainfall products in vegetation growth simulations. To do so, three satellite‐based precipitation products are chosen for their representativeness of current satellite‐based rainfall products. They are intercompared over a wide region that include the Sahel (10°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E), and tested against rainfall maps derived by kriging from the network of rain gauge data available over a slightly smaller region (10°N–17.5°N, 17.5°W–22.5°E) that encompasses the nine member countries of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS). The different data sets are presented in , and the methodology for comparing these precipitation products is detailed in . describes the main results obtained for each criterion of comparison (spatial pattern, rainfall daily occurrence, and dry spell duration and distribution, and rainfall amounts), and illustrates how these different rainfall attributes have an impact on the numerical simulations of the Sahelian vegetation at a regional scale, especially by comparing simulated vegetation fields to vegetation index maps from satellite observations. A concluding discussion is given in . Precipitation Data Sets Satellite Precipitation Products Retrieving rainfall fields at fine scale – i.e., 10–50 km and 1–3 h resolutions – is highly challenging, especially in the Sahel. Great improvements in satellite‐based rainfall estimation are provided by combining geostationary IR measurements with passive MW measurements. Indeed, if the satellite‐borne MW instruments can provide rainfall rates with good accuracy, only two measurements per day are available at the same location because of the polar orbit of the satellite. Conversely, the geostationary IR satellites offer a quasi continuous temporal coverage but less precise quantitative information. More recently, active MW measurements (radar) have also been used aboard satellites for precipitation measurements, providing a more accurate estimate of rain intensities but with a lower time sampling than that of IR and passive MW satellites. Three rainfall precipitation products derived from satellite measurements have been selected with regard to their spatial and temporal resolution ( ). The Climate Prediction Center Morphing (CMORPH) [ ] and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42v.6 [ ] precipitation products are available at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and a 3 h time step. Among the products that present the required temporal and spatial resolutions, CMORPH is considered as typical from the real‐time products like Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) [ ] or TRMM Real‐Time product (TRMM3B42‐RT) [ ]. In the same way, the TRMM3B42 is taken as representative of global well‐calibrated products such as Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMAP) [ ], besides the fact that TRMM3B42 is widely used by the scientific community [e.g., ; ; ]. The Rainfall Estimate (RFE2.0) product [ ] has a finer spatial resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) and a daily time step. It is chosen as a typical regional African rainfall product, like Estimation des Precipitations par Satellite‐Seconde Generation (EPSAT‐SG) [ ]. For these three products, the algorithms combine several types of measurements, mainly IR and MW, and two of them (RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42) also incorporate data from rain gauge measurements. These two last products have already demonstrated good skills over the Sahelian belt when compared with rain gauge observations in terms of precipitation distribution and basic statistical parameters [e.g., ; ], which justify the present effort to better characterize their ability as input in vegetation modeling. The CMORPH product has been selected to investigate the confidence that could be expected from near‐real‐time vegetation modeling. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Product 3B42v.6 (TRMM3B42) The TRMM started in 1997 in a partnership between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). First, each MW satellite observation (SSM/I, Special Sensor Microwave Imager; TMI, TRMM Microwave Imager; AMSR, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer; and AMSU, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) is converted to rainfall estimate using its proper algorithm. Then the microwave precipitation estimates are calibrated and combined (using probability matching of precipitation rate histograms). Then, IR precipitation estimates (GMS, Geostationary Meteorological Satellite; GOES, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, Meteosat; and NOAA‐12, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) are created using the calibrated MW precipitation, and the MW and IR estimates are combined. As a last step, monthly accumulated rain gauge data from the Climate Assessment and Monitoring System (CAMS) produced by NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and rain gauge product from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) are incorporated [ ] ( ). Rainfall Estimate 2.0 (RFE2.0) The RFE2.0 product was developed at NOAA by the CPC [ ]. The algorithm merges IR (GOES), passive MW (AMSU, SSM/I), and gauge measurements as follows: each type of satellite observation is converted to a rainfall estimate using its proper algorithm, then weights are calculated for each satellite rainfall estimate by comparison to gauge measurements (when and where they are available). The rainfall estimates are combined using these weights to remove random error. Then systematic bias is eliminated by adjusting the relative distribution previously obtained to gauge measurements which provide the magnitude of the rainfall field. As mentioned in , the gauges used in this algorithm are the ones belonging to the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) network, which consists of about 1000 operating gauges in Africa. CPC MORPHing (CMORPH) The CMORPH product [ ] has been developed by the NOAA CPC. The algorithm is based on a combination of passive MW observations from low‐orbited satellites (the TMI, three SSM/I, three AMSU, and one AMSR) with spatial propagation information deduced from IR observations obtained by geostationary satellites (Meteosat) ( ). More precisely, MW observations are converted to cloud features and rainfall estimates. When no passive MW data are available, the cloud features previously obtained are propagated by motion vectors derived from IR imagery, and then morphed using a linear combination of weights regarding the time from the nearest passive MW sensor. Thus, in this algorithm, IR imagery is not used to estimate rainfall but to derive motion vectors. Gauge Data Three networks of rain gauges are working in the Sahel. The whole operational CILSS network is composed of about 600 rain gauges located in nine African countries (Burkina‐Faso, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Cape‐Verde Islands, Gambia, Guinea‐Bissau, Chad, and Mauritania). The AGRométéorologie‐HYdrologie‐METéorologie (AGRHYMET) regional center (CRA) manages a monitoring network composed of about 250 rain gauges that is included in the CILSS network. The data are available on a 10‐day basis at the CRA. The synoptic network (SYNOP) is composed of 80 rain gauges, and data are available on a daily basis through the GTS. This network is included in the CRA network [ ]. The average number of gauges from these networks is around 600, but it can vary significantly from one year to another [ ]. The present localization of the CILSS and SYNOP stations is provided on . These networks have a relatively dense coverage at the regional scale with a density of approximately one station per 3500 km 2 . However, the stations are not homogeneously distributed over the region. The network is sparser in the northern part of the area, and no data are available over Nigeria (10°N–12.5°N, 4°E–14°E). After testing different kriging algorithms, proposed a method to deliver optimized interpolated precipitation fields based on the measurements from these networks. These interpolated fields are produced at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° with a 10‐day time step. They extend from 10°N to 17.5°N and from 17.5°W to 22.5°E, except for the year 2007 for which they cover the area ranging between 17.25°W–22.25°E and 10.25°N–20.25°N. Since the kriged data are not real ground truth, they carry an uncertainty that might bias comparisons with other rainfall field estimates [ ; ; ]. These interpolations of rain gauge measurements will be, in a certain extent, considered in this study as the “best estimate” against which satellite‐based products are compared, as shown by . However, the possible bias due to the scarcity of the rain gauge network must be kept in mind since the uncertainty on rainfall estimates depends strongly on the rain gauge network density and on the duration of aggregation [ ]. Methodology Both the intercomparison of three satellite‐derived rainfall products and the test of these products with the map of precipitation fields interpolated from rain gauge data are performed with several criteria relevant to vegetation modeling in the Sahel. As indicated in section 2.2, the rainfall fields resulting from kriging rain gauge data cannot be considered as “the truth” since they can present strong uncertainties, particularly when rainfall is weak and gauges density is low, as in northern Sahel (north of latitude 15°N) and at the edges of the rainy seasons [ , ]. To deal with these limitations, decided to retain only grid cells with at least one gauge in it, but only 21% of the grid cells satisfy this condition over the June to September periods from 2004 to 2006. Moreover, the kriged data are only available at a 10‐day time scale, which does not enable comparisons to be performed on the daily distribution of the rainfall and the timing of dry spells. For these two reasons (sparsity of the gauge network in the north of the area and decadal time step), intercomparisons between the different satellite‐based products are performed to provide useful information that complements results obtained with the kriged‐satellite products comparison. Indeed, although they are based on similar measurements (IR and MW satellite observations, and rain gauges for two of them), the three selected satellite products are established with different algorithms. The consistency between the three products is thus investigated first. The comparison with interpolated gauges measurements enables to estimate the quality of the satellite‐based products in terms of agreement with ground‐based data sets. As emphasized by , each criterion can lead to a different ranking of the products; it is thus important to consider a range of criteria. Here, three criteria are selected: the spatial pattern of rain fields that should contribute to retrieve the spatial pattern of vegetation growth at a regional scale; the frequency of rainy days and the occurrence of dry spells because of the strong sensitivity of Sahelian vegetation to the temporal distribution of the rain [see e.g., ; ; ]; and the precipitation amounts as a driver of vegetation growth and amount [ ; ]. For each of these three criteria, the comparison is carried out following , by answering the following questions: how does the quality of the products vary in space? how does this quality vary through time? and what is the quantitative difference between the products? The comparison is carried out over 4 years, 2004 to 2007. This duration is a compromise between the availability of the different data sets and the minimum duration required to take into consideration, at least in part, the interannual variability of the precipitation in the Sahel region [see e.g., ]. In each year, the investigated period is restricted to the rainy season, i.e., from May to October, as in the study by . The intercomparisons of satellite‐based rainfall products have been performed over the whole Sahelian belt (10°N–20°N; 20°W–35°E). The kriged rain gauge data sets being available only from 10°N to 17.5°N and from 17.5°W to 22.5°E, the comparisons between the satellite products and these data sets have been restricted to this area. CMORPH and TRMM3B42 products are both provided with a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and can therefore be compared directly at this resolution. Besides, the resolution of the RFE2.0 product is finer (0.1° × 0.1°). However, for the sake of consistency, the RFE2.0 product has been aggregated at the same resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° as CMORPH and TRMM3B42. The time scales used in the intercomparison of satellite products range from 1 to 10 days, depending on the data sets. Because of the resolution of the data set, the comparisons with rain gauge kriged data are performed at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° with a temporal resolution of 10 days. The results of the tests on the structure, frequency, dry spells, and amounts of the precipitation fields are successively presented in . Results Spatial Structure of the Precipitation Fields The first step of our analysis is to check the global consistency between the different satellite‐based precipitation products and of these satellite products with the kriged data. Although the good skills of the selected products have been demonstrated by and , this step is performed to confirm these results over the Sahel region from 2004 to 2007, which are wider and longer than in the previous studies. The objectives of this section are (1) to check the location and the extent of the rainfall fields and the consistency of their relative proportions and (2) to estimate the consistency of the temporal variation of the structure of the rainfall fields between the products. This is performed by examining (1) the spatial distribution of the precipitation cumulated over the 4‐year period and (2) the average temporal variation of the normalized precipitation rates. Satellite‐Based Products Intercomparison Spatial Distribution of the Rainfall Field The consistency of the spatial distribution of the precipitation fields is first examined at the regional scale. To this end, the precipitation fields from each product are cumulated over the four rainy seasons (values over oceanic areas are disregarded). In order to minimize the variability due to differences in rainfall intensity between the satellite products, the cumulated precipitations are normalized to their respective maximum over the whole studied area. The consistency of precipitation fields at regional scale is checked by examining the distribution of the annual mean rainfall for the rainy season (May to October) averaged over the period 2004–2007 ( ). The CMORPH distribution is much more stretched than those of the two other satellite products, with a mean value of 527 mm, against 303 mm for TRMM3B42 and 314 mm for RFE2.0, and a maximum value of 2409 mm, against 1419 mm for TRMM3B42 and 1177 mm for RFE2.0. However, the mean/maximum ratio is similar for CMORPH and TRMM3B42 (0.22 and 0.21), while it is slightly higher for RFE2.0 (0.26), indicating that this product shows more frequent high‐precipitation events. The three satellite‐based precipitation products provide similar spatial structure of rainfall fields over the Sahel ( ). Especially, both the northern limit of observed precipitations (located around 18°N in the western part and 15°N in the eastern part) and the location of the relative maxima (located around 15°W and 12°N and around 8°E and 10°N) are clearly coherent in the three products. On the other hand, some differences are observed in the southern part of the area between 20°E and 30°E with very low normalized precipitation values for TRMM3B42, while CMORPH and RFE2.0 products suggest relatively high precipitation in that area. Nevertheless, the spatial structures of all three satellite‐based precipitation products are largely coherent. Ten‐Day Rainfall Variability To evaluate the consistency between the different satellite products through time, the spatial correlation coefficients between pairs of satellite products are computed every 10‐day period from May to October over the 4‐year period. As already pointed out by , the correlation coefficient measures the cofluctuation of the products and is not sensitive to bias. The computed correlation coefficients range between 0.6 and 0.9 (for n∼8000 for CMORPH/TRMM3B42, n∼2000 for CMORPH/RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42/RFE2.0), indicating a significant level of coherence at the decadal time step between the different data sets. Moreover, the values of the correlation coefficients do not vary significantly along the rainy season nor during the 4‐year period: for a given year, the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient is around 5% of its annual mean for CMORPH/RFE2.0 and CMORPH/TRMM3B42, and around 8% for TRMM3B42/RFE2.0. They are also stable from one year to the other: for each couple of satellite‐based products, the standard deviation of the annual means is ∼2% of the 4‐year global mean. It must be noted that the correlation coefficients are more scattered in 2005 (with CMORPH/TRMM3B42 having the lowest values), and to a lesser extent in 2007. These results suggest that the quality of the satellite products remains relatively constant from the intraseasonal to the interannual time scales. Comparison with Kriged Rain Gauge Fields Spatial Comparison The three satellite products are compared with the precipitation fields derived from kriged gauge measurements (further referred as “kriged fields”). In a first step, the comparison is performed on the cumulated and normalized precipitation fields, for the area over which kriged fields are available, i.e., about one half of the area previously concerned for the satellite‐based precipitation products comparisons. The kriged fields over most of Nigeria (see , white box), are excluded from the analysis since no gauge measurements were available from this country. For each product, the distribution of the 4‐year mean rainfall field was first examined over the area where rain gauge measurements are available ( ). As already observed over the large domain, the CMORPH distribution is much more stretched than those of the two other rainfall satellite products with a mean value of 770 mm, against 445 mm for TRMM3B42, 453 mm for RFE2.0, and 424 mm for the kriged fields. The maximum values are 2409 mm for CMORPH, 1419 mm for TRMM3B42, 1177 mm for RFE2.0, and 1330 mm for the kriged fields. The mean/maximum ratio is similar for CMORPH, TRMM3B42, and the kriged fields (0.32, 0.31, and 0.32), while it is again slightly higher for RFE2.0 (0.38). The main patterns of the rainfall fields are similar for the kriged fields and the satellite products ( ). The relative maxima of precipitations are located in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the studied area for all precipitation data sets. However, some disagreements are observed in the southwestern part of the area, where the extent of high precipitation is larger on kriged fields than on the satellite‐based rainfall fields. Note that the density of the gauge network is important in this region, and thus, the confidence level of the associated kriged fields is high. On the other hand, the computation of the kriged fields should yield a smoother spatial pattern of precipitation fields, and this can partly explain the differences observed between kriged fields and satellite‐based rainfall fields in this area. Ten‐Day Variability The spatial correlation coefficients between the decadal rainfall fields derived from satellite‐based precipitation products and the kriged fields are computed from 2004 to 2007 (not shown; n∼1200). The resulting correlation coefficients are lower than those obtained for the intercomparison of the different satellite‐based precipitation products. They range approximately between 0.3 and 0.9 (against 0.6 to 0.9 for the intercomparison), and about 9% of the values are lower than 0.6. The correlation coefficient is particularly weak from May to August 2005 for the TRMM3B42. However, these correlation coefficients remain largely significant, indicating an overall good agreement between satellite‐based precipitation products and kriged fields. By taking into account estimation error uncertainty, especially sampling error [ , ], comparisons would yield to even higher correlation coefficients [see ]. The correlation coefficients are stable over the rainy season: for a given year, the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient is ∼10% of its annual mean for CMORPH and RFE2.0 (against 8% for satellite products only) and 12% to 27% for TRMM3B42. When averaged over the rainfall season (May to October), the correlation coefficients are stable from one year to another: for the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products, the standard deviation of its annual mean is about 2% of the 4‐year global mean. This variability of the correlation coefficients is higher for the TRMM3B42 product, with a standard deviation of its annual mean of 8% of the 4‐year global mean, mainly because of the poor agreement observed for 2005. Conclusion Concerning the Spatial Structure of the Precipitation Field The three selected satellite‐based precipitation products provide coherent spatial structure of the rainfall fields over the whole Sahel. Moreover, the comparisons between these satellite products and the gauge‐interpolated measurements, even if they have been performed over a smaller area, suggest that the structures provided by the satellite products are also in good agreement with precipitation fields derived from gauge measurements. This reinforces the results obtained by previous studies on smaller areas and shorter periods [ ; ]. Rainfall Frequency and Dry Spells As shown by , the spatial distribution of total precipitation amounts is first determined by the number of rain events at different locations, and second, by how much it rains during these events. Moreover, rainfall frequency and dry spell occurrences are critical issues for vegetation growth. This has already been pointed out among others by for crops. The aim of this section is to check if the rainy days and the dry spells occur at the same time for a same location, and in the same proportions for the three satellite‐based rainfall products. Since kriged fields are only available at the 10‐day time scale (which is not sufficient to work on rainy days or to detect short dry spells), this analysis is carried out on a daily basis, but between satellite products only. The annual number of rainy days is assessed separately for each rainy season 2004–2007 and for each satellite‐based precipitation products ( ). The mean annual values vary between approximately 100 and 150 rainy days (for a 184‐day period) at the very south of the studied area to 0 rainy day at its northeastern edge. CMORPH and RFE2.0 show very similar patterns, while the TRMM3B42 product provides a lower number of rainy days, especially over the 10°N–12°N latitudinal band. Satellite Based Precipitation Products Global Scores The consistency of the rainfall frequency provided by the satellite‐based precipitation products has been quantified by computing an agreement score between the different products in terms of the detection of rainy days (rainfall > 0 mm) or nonrainy days (rainfall = 0 mm). These scores (expressed in percent) have been computed for each pixel and for the 4‐year period of interest (2004–2007) over the Sahel. Four cases have been distinguished: (1) the two satellite products A and B agree on the rainy day (y/y); (2) the two satellite products A and B agree on the nonrainy day (n/n); (3) product A indicates a rainy day, but product B does not (y/n); and (4) product A indicates a nonrainy day and product B indicates a rainy day (n/y). These categories can be compared with the False Alarm Ratio (FAR) and the Probability of Detection (POD) as defined in . However, since we do not have any absolute reference here in terms of daily rain detection, we preferred to use explicit names of the different cases. The scores corresponding to agreements for rainy (y/y) or nonrainy days (n/n) are high (about 80% when summed) for the three pairs of satellite products ( ). These scores are almost equally driven by the rainy and the nonrainy cases, the number of y/y cases being slightly lower than the number of n/n cases. Concerning the cases of disagreement (y/n and n/y), it can be noted that RFE2.0 detects more rainy days than CMORPH, which detects more rainy days than TRMM3B42 (as also observed in ). Since the mean annual rainfall was higher for CMORPH than for RFE2.0 (see and ), this suggests that the precipitation events are of lower intensity for RFE2.0 than for CMORPH. A complementary insight about the consistency of rain distribution between the studied products bears on the dry spell analysis. Usually, a dry spell is defined as a period of consecutive days without rain, embedded in the rainy season [e.g., ; ]. A threshold can be defined to detect the next rainy day that ends the current dry spell. A criterion has also to be defined to detect the beginning of the rainy season or the date of a possible germination, in order to reduce the analysis to the sensitive period for vegetation. Based on the work of and , it was decided to define the date of possible germination by the first day after 1 May when rainfall is at least 12 mm or when rainfall accumulated over 5 days is at least 20 mm. The analysis is carried out until the end of September, since October matches with the senescence stage, when annual vegetation is not sensitive anymore to dry spells. Moreover, a very simple hydrologic budget is computed by subtracting an evapotranspiration of 2 mm per day [see ]. Here, a dry spell is thus defined as consecutive days with a null hydrologic budget. The global mean dry spell distribution over the 2004–2007 seasons restricted as described above is expressed in terms of the relative area concerned by dry spells by counting the number of grid cells concerned for each dry spell duration and dividing it by the total number of grid cells ( ). Similar behavior is observed from the three selected satellite‐based rainfall products: dry spells shorter than 4 days are numerous (over 20% to 35% of the area), then the distribution shows a strong decrease (5‐day dry spell represents about 5% to 10% of the area), and a continuous decay for longer dry spell (dry spells longer than 20 days bring a very small contribution). The proportion of the studied area concerned by dry spells is of the same order for the three products. However, there is a local maximum in the distribution for the 4‐day dry spells for TRMM3B42 and CMORPH, which does not appear for RFE2.0. All these observations remain valid when performing a year‐by‐year analysis (not shown). Spatial Comparison The scores of agreement (y/y and n/n) of the different satellite‐based precipitation products have been cumulated for the four rainy seasons and are displayed on maps ( ). Large parts of the area (76%, 60%, and 37% for CMORPH/RFE2.0, CMORPH/TRMM3B42 and TRMM3B42/RFE2.0, respectively) show agreement greater than 80%. The higher levels of agreement are reached over the regions where precipitations are either very high (central south of the area) or very weak (northern part of the area). The minimum score is about 40%. For the three pairs of satellite‐based precipitation products, the agreement scores are lower (but still higher than 50%) between 14°N and 16°N, i.e., the zone corresponding to the northern limit of the precipitation and along the Atlantic Ocean coast. Smaller areas of disagreement are located in regions including water bodies such as Lake Chad (13°N, 15°E). This is likely due to a “mixed pixel” effect (pixels over Lake Chad are considered as coastal water or coastal land) which reinforces the inconsistency due to the differences between the proper algorithms of the three products: propagation of passive MW along the motion vectors derived from IR measurements for CMORPH, weighted mean of MW retrieval and IR‐based estimates (adjusted by monthly gauge data at nearby location) for TRMM3B42, and a similar methodology for RFE2.0 (adjusted by daily gauge data) but with different sets of passive MW and IR estimations derived from a different technique. The lowest agreement scores are obtained for the couple TRMM3B42/RFE2.0. This is consistent with the global scores given in the previous section, indicating that the RFE2.0 product detects more rainy days than TRMM3B42. Besides water bodies, disagreements are thus located over areas of intermediate rainfall amounts. The geographical pattern of the mean annual number of dry spells lasting 5 days or more ( ) brings complementary information. As expected, a north‐south gradient appears, with more dry spells at the northwest of the area (with a lighter extent for TRMM3B42), and almost none at its southern edge. Numerous dry spells are also observed between 30°E and 35°E at 16°N, particularly for the TRMM3B42 product. Gray cells correspond to “always‐dry” zones (where the germination criterion is never met); these gray cells are least numerous for the CMORPH product. In other words, slight differences are observed between products in terms of spatial repartition of the dry spells, particularly in zones where vegetation is the least likely to develop (north and east). A specific analysis of the impacts of these differences on vegetation simulations is carried out further. Daily Variability To evaluate the temporal variability of the agreement in detecting rainy days, scores of agreement (y/y and n/n) or disagreement (y/n and n/y) are computed for each day of each year over the whole area. The results obtained for year 2006 are displayed in . The temporal evolutions of these scores differs from one couple of rainfall products to the other. For each couple, the agreement on rainy days increases from the beginning to the middle of the rainy season and then decreases. Total precipitation exhibits the same pattern [see e.g., ] suggesting a coinciding increase of the frequency and intensity of the precipitation, in agreement with the observations of . On the other hand, the agreement score on nonrainy days is obviously the minimum at the maximum of the rainy season and the maximum at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, where nonrainy days are the most frequent cases. The total agreement scores are stable during the whole period for the couple CMORPH/RFE2.0, but exhibit a slight seasonal trend for the pairs involving the TRMM3B42 product, suggesting a seasonal bias in the detection of rainy days for this product. For the CMORPH/RFE2.0 couple, the two scores corresponding to disagreement (y/n and n/y) have comparable values and temporal patterns. The scores for the pairs involving TRMM3B42 differ significantly, underlining, as noticed previously, that the TRMM3B42 product detects less rainy days than the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products. The same features are noticed for the other years of the studied period (not shown). A similar day‐by‐day analysis in terms of dry spells yields similar conclusions (not shown): the mean dry spell duration is longer at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, and it reaches a minimum at its core. This mean duration is slightly greater for CMORPH since the dry spells computation for this product includes more cells (that meet the germination criterion) at the northern edge of the area of interest, which shows low rainfall and very strong intermittency. Conclusion on Rainfall Frequency and Dry Spells A satisfying global agreement between the different satellite‐based precipitation products was found for the daily rain detection and dry spell analysis, especially in areas where rainfall is either very weak or very strong. A weakest, but still very good agreement is also observed in areas exhibiting intermediate rainfall patterns, i.e., in the Sahelian area stricto sensu (100 to 600 mm, i.e., approximately between 14°N and 16°N, see ). This underlines the need to focus analysis on the specific criterion of rainfall daily frequency. Moreover, this good level of agreement persists all through the rainy season. For the TRMM3B42 product, the comparison with the other satellite‐based precipitation products suggests a seasonal bias in the detection of the rainy days, and a slightly different spatial distribution of dry spells. As a general trend, the rainfall frequency is the highest with the RFE2.0 product and the lowest with the TRMM3B42 product. Rainfall Amounts The consistency of the precipitation amounts is examined for the different satellite‐based precipitation products. First, a direct comparison is performed over the whole Sahel and over the CILSS countries area; second, the spatial distribution of the rainfall differences between products is examined; finally, the temporal evolution of the agreement between products is evaluated. Satellite Products Ten‐Day Precipitation Amounts Direct comparisons of 10 day precipitation amounts from a couple of satellite‐based precipitation products are performed at a spatial resolution of 0.5° (n∼100,000) over the whole Sahel (10°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E, values over oceans being removed) for the four rainy seasons of the period 2004–2007 ( ). Overall, the agreement between the three satellite‐based products is good: the correlation coefficients range between 0.41 and 0.65, and the slopes of the linear regression range from 1.48 to 0.78. The slope of the linear relationships between the CMORPH and RFE2.0 products is the highest (1.48) and is associated with the slowest intercept (4.3 mm) and a medium mean absolute error (17.8 mm). The squared correlation is the highest with about 0.65 (meaning that 65% of the variability of the data is explained by the linear regression). The slope of the linear relationship between the TRMM3B42 and CMORPH products is very close to 1, but the intercept and the mean absolute error are the highest (13.1 mm and 21.4 mm, respectively), suggesting a small systematic bias between these two products. The correlation coefficient is lower (0.43) and close to the 1 obtained for the TRMM3B42/RFE2.0 couple (0.41). The linear regression between TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 gives a slope of 0.8, without significant systematic bias (intercept ∼5.56 mm). Moreover the mean absolute error is the lowest with 13.66 mm. Spatial Distribution of Precipitation Amounts The differences between the different satellite‐based precipitation products in terms of precipitation amounts over the four rainy seasons 2004–2007 are displayed in . The highest differences in precipitation amounts involve the CMORPH product. The regions where the differences are the highest are located along the Guinean coast (15°W–10°W, 10°N) and in the southern part of the area, i.e., in the areas where precipitation is the highest. These areas almost perfectly match the maximum of relative precipitation of the CMORPH product. This clearly shows that the precipitation amounts derived from CMORPH are much higher than those from the two other products. In contrast, the areas where the differences are minimum are located at the northern edge of the studied area where rainfall is extremely weak. The two satellite‐based precipitation products using rain gauge data for adjusting their precipitation rates retrievals, i.e., TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0, are in good agreement over most of the area. The differences are less than 100 mm in mean annual absolute value for 47%, 47%, and 87% of the studied area for CMORPH‐RFE2.0, CMORPH‐TRMM3B42, and TRMM3B42‐RFE2.0, respectively. Higher differences are observed in a zone located in Sudan (25°E–35°E, 10°N–12°N) for which the precipitation derived from TRMM3B42 is significantly lower than that derived from RFE2.0. As indicated in , the frequency of rain days detected is intermediate between the two other products for the CMORPH product. This strongly suggests that the large differences observed in the precipitation amount retrieved by CMORPH and those provided by the two other satellite‐based precipitation products result from a large “overestimation” of the daily precipitation rates for rainy days similarly detected by the other products. This overestimation of the rainfall amounts by CMORPH had already been noticed by for the June‐September 2004–2006 period and by at a global scale. Ten‐Day Variability In order to evaluate the consistency between the different satellite‐based precipitation products through time, the slopes of the linear regressions have been computed every 10‐day period from May to October over the 4 year‐period over the Sahel region. These slopes show a systematic trend: rainfall amounts derived from the RFE2.0 product are lower than those derived from TRMM3B42 (slope between 0.4 and 1) except at the very beginning and at the end of the rainy season (when the slope can reach ∼1.2). RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 values are much lower than those derived from CMORPH (slope from 0.2 to 0.8). The slopes, averaged over the rainy seasons are quite stable with standard deviations of the order of ∼10%. However, they can strongly vary as a function of the year for the same decade, with standard deviations up to 40%. Comparison with Kriged Rain Gauge Data Decadal Precipitation Amounts The precipitation amounts at 0.5° spatial resolution derived from the satellite products are cumulated by 10 day period to be compared with the 10‐days precipitation amounts from the kriged rain gauge data ( , n∼80 000). The comparison of the 10 day precipitation amounts shows a good agreement between satellite‐based estimates and kriged data: the squared correlation coefficients range between 0.6 and 0.7. These values are similar to those obtained by , but the number of values compared here is much higher; our period of interest is longer and our area is wider. The slopes of the linear regressions range between 0.77 and 1.34, and the intercepts are low (between 2.2 mm and 8 mm). The level of agreement is thus noticeably better than the agreement observed between satellite products, and compares well with the values obtained by on two 10‐day periods (11–20 June 2006 and 1–10 August 2006), taking into account estimation errors (squared correlations about 0.9, slopes about 0.8 to 1.3). If the kriged data are considered as a reference in terms of precipitation amounts, these results indicate that CMORPH overestimates precipitation amounts by about 34%, with a much larger systematic bias than the other products as reflected by the highest intercept (∼8 mm) and mean absolute error (22.2 mm). On the other hand, RFE2.0 tends to underestimate precipitation rates by 23%, with a lower bias (intercept ∼5 mm) than CMORPH and the lowest mean absolute error (∼10 mm). Moreover, RFE2.0 shows the highest squared correlation, with more than 69% of the variability of the values explained by the linear regression. TRMM3B42 exhibits the slope the closest to 1 (0.94) and the lower intercept (∼2 mm), suggesting a better agreement with the kriged rain gauge data in terms of precipitation rates. However, its squared correlation is 0.6, i.e., approximately equal to that of the CMORPH product. Spatial Distribution The differences in precipitation amounts between the satellite‐based precipitation products minus the kriged rain gauge data are computed for the four rainy seasons ( ). The largest differences are again located along the Guinean coast (13°W, 10°N), and the lowest ones, for the RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 products, are located in an intermediate strip, approximately between 13°N and 15°N. The differences are positive between the CMORPH data and the kriged rain gauge data, indicating much stronger precipitation amounts from the satellite‐based data. The RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 products are both in satisfying agreement with the kriged rain gauge data over most of the area with absolute differences lower than 100 mm over 78% and 76%, respectively, of the surface, but for only 27% for CMORPH. The kriged rain gauge data are generally slightly lower than the satellite products in the areas where high rainfall is observed (central and southern) and slightly greater on the northern borders, where rainfall is the weakest. The underestimation of satellite‐based products with respect to kriged data for low rainfall amounts can be partly explained by the underestimation of the frequency of small rainfall linked to high spatial intermittency [ ]. Ten‐Day Variability The slopes of the linear regressions of precipitation amounts every 10 day period between satellite‐based precipitation products and kriged rain gauge data (not shown) confirm the differences previously noted between the three satellite products. The slopes between satellite products and kriged data are higher at the beginning and at the end of the rainy seasons, while they are minimum, and generally closer to 1, in the middle of the rainy season. This better agreement with kriged data at the core of the rainy season was also observed for other satellite‐based rainfall products [ ]. For the CMORPH product, they largely exceed 1 both at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season, while they range between 1 and 2 between July and September. This indicates that the precipitation amounts are overestimated by CMORPH during the whole rainy season, but less toward the middle of the wet season. Moreover, the interannual variability observed is the strongest with the CMORPH product. The slopes of the regressions with RFE2.0 and TRMM3B42 are significantly closer to 1, even if they also decrease in the middle of the wet season to reach values of the order of 0.5. This suggests that these two satellite products could underestimate precipitation amounts during a period of high rainfall. It can be noticed that the values for 11–20 June 2006 and 1–10 August 2006 for the TRMM3B42 product compare very well with the values obtained by (slopes of 0.83 and 1.29, respectively). The three satellite‐based rainfall products studied here show similar field structure and daily frequency over the Sahel. Those characteristics are also in good agreement with the 10‐day kriged rain gauge data over the Sahel. However, the CMORPH product tends to overestimate rainfall amount over the Sahelian belt. In the following section, we will discuss the influence of the use of these different rainfall fields on the Sahelian vegetation modeling. Vegetation Modeling Simulations of seasonal variations of the Sahel vegetation have been performed with the STEP model [ ]. This model has been specifically designed to simulate, at a daily time scale, the growth of the Sahel annual herbaceous by describing explicitly the physical and biological processes associated to plant growth (photosynthesis, respiration, senescence, and litter production) and water budget (evaporation, transpiration, and water fluxes in the soil). The modeled vegetation consists of an herbaceous layer composed of annual species. From the simulated biomass, vegetation structural parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Vegetation Cover Fraction, and vegetation height are estimated, allowing comparisons with satellite or field measurements [e.g., ; ]. The main required input data sets are daily meteorological data (air temperature, global radiation, and rainfall) and soil characteristics (texture with depth, albedo), input parameters being the initial green biomass (B g0 ), the C3/C4‐plants proportion, the maximum conversion efficiency (ɛ c ), and the Specific Leaf Area at emergence (SLA 0 ) (see ). Implementation of the STEP Model at the Regional Scale The STEP model [ ] is a one‐dimensional model that has been designed to run on well‐documented sites. The aim here is to perform vegetation simulations over the whole area of interest, i.e., to determine the values of the different input variables and parameters. In that regard, the strategy depends on the model sensitivity to these inputs. The most determinant input variables are first, daily rainfall, and second, solar radiation, yet solar radiations seldom limit vegetation photosynthesis in the Sahel environment, contrary to rainfall. Calibration Parameters According to several previous studies dealing with the STEP model [e.g., , ; ], the most sensitive parameters are the maximum conversion efficiency ɛ c , the initial green biomass B g0 , the C3/C4‐plants proportion, and the Specific Leaf Area at emergence SLA 0 . A thorough description of these parameters can be found in the article by . The C3/C4‐plant proportions and SLA 0 are difficult to evaluate at a regional scale. Default values obtained from 25 years of ground measurements over the AMMA‐CATCH site in Mali [ ; ; ] are considered here, and in consequence, the simulations are performed on an area restricted in latitude (12°N–20°N, 20°W–35°E) to match with the appropriate type of vegetation. The two other calibration parameters, B g0 and ɛ c , are determined using satellite observation products as reference. The LAI designates the one‐sided leaf surface per soil unit surface (in m 2 /m 2 ). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product [ ] – onboard the TERRA and AQUA platforms – is retained for its fine resolution (∼1 km, 8 days) and its good skills over Sahel [ ; ], except an offset of about 0.2 m 2 /m 2 during the dry season. Using both the MODIS LAI data (LAI MODIS ) as a reference and typical values of SLA for Sahelian grass species [ ], the initial biomass is estimated as follows: B g0 = LAI MODIS /SLA. From this, regional simulations have been performed and values for the ɛ c parameter have been determined by minimizing the difference between simulations and MODIS LAI data in four zones. These zones were defined for their contrasted behaviors in terms of absolute differences with respect to MODIS LAI values. The obtained values range between 3.0 and 6.0 g/MJ, which are in agreement with previous studies [e.g., ; ]. Meteorological Data and Soil Characteristics As mentioned in section 1, the objective is to evaluate different rainfall products as inputs in regional vegetation modeling. Thus, the three satellite‐based rainfall products were successively used as inputs to perform vegetation simulations using the STEP model. The other meteorological parameters are operational data from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). Soil texture profiles are adapted from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) [ ], which is the finest available soil database. Its resolution is ∼1 km, but data were aggregated at the 0.1° or 0.25°, depending on the rainfall product used. Surface albedo is the product provided by the MODIS database. Vegetation Simulations and Comparisons to MODIS Observations Vegetation Dynamics The seasonal dynamics of the green biomass is simulated for the year 2004 by using TRMM3B42 rainfall data ( ). No green vegetation is simulated during the dry season until approximately beginning of July (day of year (DOY) 180). As simulated by the STEP model, annual vegetation starts growing as soon as the humidity of the soil is greater than the wilting point during 5 consecutive days. The plant growth lasts until approximately early September (DOY 250) matching with the biomass maximum and the fructification stage. Finally, the senescence takes place from the maximum of biomass to end of October (DOY 280). The sensitivity of the simulations to the use of the different satellite‐based rainfall products is evaluated by examining the main features of the vegetation dynamics over years 2004 to 2007: the location of the northern limit of the vegetated area, the date of beginning of the plant growth (T 0 ), the date of biomass maximum, and the LAI values at T 0 + 15 days and at maximum. In the context of the strong latitudinal rainfall gradient in Sahel, the latitudinal location of the northern limit of annual vegetation growth is an important issue in estimating the regional agreement between simulated and observed seasonal vegetation. More precisely, the following comparison aims at checking whether the modeled vegetation is spatially and temporally consistent at the regional scale with the satellite observations. The grid cells for which the northern limit of the vegetated area is detected are reported according to their latitude as obtained from STEP simulations versus their latitude as obtained from MODIS observations ( ). Their cumulated frequency across longitude over the whole area of interest is indicated through a color scale. The graphs illustrate the cumulated results over years 2004 to 2007 for the first day of each month from May to October (growing season) and separately for each satellite‐based rainfall product used as rainfall inputs in the STEP model. The correlation coefficient between latitude of the northern limit of simulated and observed vegetation is also indicated on each panel. The grid cells are smaller and more numerous for the RFE2.0 product as its resolution is 0.1. A perfect agreement between observations and simulations would correspond to all grid cells aligned on the 1:1 line. On the whole, seasonal vegetation is not well developed before July, and the agreement between simulations and observations is poor until this date. The best agreement is observed for 1 August and 1 September, whatever the rainfall product, that is in the middle of the growing season when vegetation density is at maximum. A poor agreement is also observed for 1 October, corresponding to the senescence stage. This observation can be done for the three rainfall products suggesting that the STEP model does not simulate this last vegetation stage well. Moreover, the northern limit ofthe vegetated area is located further south by the model in comparison with satellite observations from August to October (the points are located above the 1:1 line). Although these trends are observed for the three satellite‐based products, correlation coefficients show some variability. The best agreement (over the whole rainy season) is found when using the CMORPH product as rainfall input, which was rather unexpected since CMORPH shows the strongest disagreement with kriged gauge rainfall data. The cumulated distributions of the date of beginning of vegetation growth for the different products are displayed in . The distributions for the simulations run with TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 show a very similar behavior, in good agreement with MODIS observations, with an inflection point at the end of May (around DOY 150), when the vegetation starts to grow over most of the area. The vegetation growth as seen by MODIS starts about 20 days earlier than the modeled values using the satellite estimates. This is mainly because the STEP model prevents vegetation to start growing before 1 May in order to avoid unrealistic starts over the whole Sahelian band. By early September (approximately DOY 250), herbaceous vegetation has started to grow in almost all grid boxes. The simulations run with CMORPH show an earlier onset of the vegetation cycle that concerns a relatively high fraction of the studied area. In other words, vegetation growth begins roughly 5 to 20 days earlier with the CMORPH product than with others. This result is in accordance with the rainfall overestimation of this product with respect to the others. The area covered by the simulated vegetation growth is also slightly larger when using CMORPH precipitation than when using the two other precipitation products (for example, in 2004: 51% (MODIS), 48% (CMORPH), 39% (RFE2.0), and 47% (TRMM3B42) of the area is covered by vegetation). The distribution of the date of vegetation maximum is less scattered between products ( ). In the simulations, the main inflection point occurs in early September (around DOY 250), and by the end of October (DOY 300) the whole vegetated area has reached its maximum whatever the satellite‐based precipitation products used as input, and for the MODIS observations as well. From a regional point of view, the simulations reach their maximum at a smoother rate than MODIS observations. TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 products show very similar responses in terms of vegetation simulation, as was expected because of their very similar daily rainfall frequency and amounts. Vegetation Amounts An illustration of the impact of differences between products on modeled vegetation in terms of dry spells is given by , for the year 2004 and the CMORPH and TRMM3B42 products. MODIS maximum LAI are represented on to facilitate the interpretation of these results. The area where TRMM3B42 presents more dry spells lasting 5 days or more than CMORPH appears on (blue color). On , as expected, this corresponds to area where the maximum simulated LAI is larger when using CMORPH than TRMM3B42 (yellow color), and where MODIS maximum LAI shows intermediate values (∼1–2 m 2 /m 2 ). However, the opposite behavior is observed at the southwest section of the area, where MODIS maximum LAI are 2 to 3 m 2 /m 2 : more dry spells for CMORPH and a larger maximum simulated LAI. This can be explained by the much higher rainfall amounts of the CMORPH product with respect to TRMM3B42 in this area (see and ). Statistical values of the linear regression between vegetation simulations and MODIS observations are given at 15 days after growth beginning, T 0 + 15 ( ) and at vegetation maximum ( ). Simulated values are well correlated with the observed ones at T 0 + 15: correlation coefficients are about 0.7 whatever the rainfall input source, and slopes are larger than 1, indicating that LAI are overestimated by the STEP model by 40% to 70%. At vegetation maximum, correlations (>0.8) show a very significant agreement between simulations and satellite observations, and intercepts are low (lower than MODIS offset in the dry season) [see ]. However, the model underestimates by almost a factor of 2 the MODIS LAI values at vegetation maximum. These results suggest that the vegetative cycle is satisfyingly reproduced by the model (see good correlation coefficients) over the whole Sahelian belt, especially in terms of seasonal dynamics. Yet, the simulated cycle is less marked than the observed one in terms of vegetation amounts. Conclusion Since the three satellite‐based precipitation products have very similar daily precipitation frequencies (see ), the large differences in dynamics observed between the simulated vegetation fields are mainly due to the overestimation of rainfall amounts by CMORPH, especially at the beginning of the rainy season. Earlier precipitation from CMORPH allows the simulation of the beginning of the vegetation growth at a period for which the necessary conditions are not yet fulfilled for the other products. When considering LAI values, the correlation coefficients are larger for CMORPH used as rainfall input, but with a wider value departure between simulated and observed LAI. In other words, comparison of vegetation simulations for the different satellite‐based product confirms that impacts of rainfall characteristics like amounts or frequencies are not straightforward on the agreement with observed vegetation. These results can be put in perspective with recent works dealing with hydrological modeling as by (who intended to build metrics interpretable by hydrologists and algorithm developers at hydrologically relevant scales) and (who studied the skills and impacts of the use of TRMM3B42RT and TRMM3B42v.6 on hydrological modeling in China). Other recent studies deal also with land‐surface modeling using satellite‐based rainfall products as by (comparisons of land‐surface models over west Africa using the TRMM3B42 product) and (computation of large‐scale water cycle over West Africa using rainfall from meteorological models). However, the impacts of rainfall estimates variability for modeling show strong specificities depending on the scientific issue under consideration [e.g., ]. Conclusion Three satellite‐based precipitation products (CMORPH, RFE2.0, and TRMM3B42) have been intercompared and tested against interpolated rain gauge measurements over a four rainy season period (2004–2007) to evaluate their ability to retrieve the precipitation characteristics that drive seasonal vegetation growth throughout the Sahel region. The criteria of comparison are defined according to their relevance for vegetation dynamics: spatial structure of the rainfall field, precipitation frequency and dry spell distribution, and precipitation amounts. The time scale used for the satellite product intercomparisons is from 1 to 10 days, and the spatial resolution is of 0.25° × 0.25° to 0.5° × 0.5°. Vegetation simulations are performed using a vegetation growth model specifically developed for Sahel over a slightly smaller area, and the simulations are compared with satellite observations (MODIS LAI). The three selected satellite products are found to be in good agreement over the Sahel region for the three criteria. In terms of spatial structure, the three satellite‐based precipitation products are also in a good agreement with the kriged rain gauge data, which is consistent with previous works performed over smaller area or periods [e.g., ; ]. Moreover, this agreement is relatively stable through time, from intraseasonal to interannual scales. The three satellite‐based precipitation products meet a high agreement (around 80%) in terms of detection of rainy days. However, the intercomparison of precipitation amounts between the satellite‐based precipitation products and the comparison of the satellite products with the kriged rain gauge data clearly indicate that the CMORPH product overestimates rainfall amounts, while both TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 are in good agreement together and with kriged rain gauge data. When considering vegetation modeling, good agreement is also observed between the dynamics of vegetation growth simulated by STEP using the satellite rainfall products and the satellite observations at a regional scale. This agreement applies to the date of vegetation growth beginning as well as the date of maximum vegetation growth. However, the amounts of vegetation at growth beginning (maximum) are overestimated (underestimated) by the model runs. Differences between satellite rainfall products are retrieved in the model outputs, particularly the earlier start of vegetation growth when using the CMORPH product. Simulations obtained with TRMM3B42 and RFE2.0 have similar behaviors, in good accordance with MODIS observations. This is in agreement with the comparable characteristics of these two products according to our intercomparison criteria. The good skills of the selected products, although already observed on shorter area or period, are confirmed over the whole Sahelian area on a pluriannual time scale. The specific analysis, focused on the use of these products for vegetation modeling, suggest a new approach and methodology of comparison, and link the results of this comparison to vegetation simulations. The present work can be considered as a typical example of synergistic research between precipitation estimation missions and surface‐vegetation‐atmosphere modeling and measurements. Among the current comparable research programs, further scientific investigations could be performed with, for example, the Megha‐Tropiques mission or the NASA/JAXA Global mission, and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) space mission.

Understanding and quantifying the impact of biomass burning (BB) on atmospheric composition and chemistry requires accurate data on the emissions of trace gases and aerosols and the incorporation of fire processes in biogeochemical and dynamic global vegetation models. Combining data sets on fuel loads and satellite‐derived burned area resulted in several bottom‐up fire carbon (C) emission estimates [e.g., Hoelzemann et al ., ; Ito and Penner , ; van der Werf et al ., ]. These studies estimated an emission range between 1 and 3 Pg C yr ‐1 and showed that fires have large IAV. A research avenue that provided new constraints on these estimates were atmospheric inversions, where measurements of atmospheric trace gases in combination with chemistry transport models provide independent validation of bottom‐up emission estimates [ Edwards et al ., ; Arellano et al ., ; Gloudemans et al ., ; Kopacz et al ., ; Hooghiemstra et al ., , ]. In many of these inversion studies, CO is used as a tracer of fire emissions due to its relatively well‐known chemistry and large departure from background conditions. The intermediate lifetime (of 2 months on average), longer than volatile compounds and aerosols emitted from fires but shorter than for example CH 4 , makes CO traceable as it travels between continents [ Edwards et al ., ; Gloudemans et al ., ]. Different satellite sensors (e.g., Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere [MOPITT], Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer, and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) are able to measure CO column concentrations and also a relatively long and consistent time series of CO from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Cooperative Air Sampling Network exists [ Novelli et al ., , ]. While our knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability of fires substantially increased in the last decade due to new satellite information, several important gaps remain in our understanding of BB emissions. During the last years, new burned area products have been developed, and validation studies indicated that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer products [ Roy et al ., ; Giglio et al ., ] identify the majority of area burned as estimated by Landsat‐derived burned area [ Roy and Boschetti , ; Giglio et al ., ]. However, the burned area algorithms have difficulty in mapping small fires [ Randerson et al ., ] as well as understory fires or fires that burn during periods with persistent cloud cover. The conversion of burned area to fire emissions also bears uncertainties; the large variability in fuel consumption often reported by field measurements studies, especially in heterogeneous landscapes, is difficult to extract from satellite data [ van der Werf et al ., ]. Another important source of uncertainty is the partitioning of combusted biomass or C into different combustion products. To translate the fire C losses to trace gases and aerosols, emission factors (EFs) are used. An EF is usually defined as the amount of a specific trace gas emitted per kg of dry matter (DM) burned, expressed in units of g kg −1 DM −1 [ Andreae and Merlet , ]. Since the launch of the first BB campaigns back in the 1980s, EFs have been measured in most fire‐prone biomes. Several summaries of experimental EF data were given [e.g., Delmas et al ., ], but the most extensive and frequently used database of all EF measurements was compiled by Andreae and Merlet [ ] with annual updates (M.O. Andreae, personal communication 2011). Recently, Akagi et al . [ ] compiled a new EF database and only included measurements of fresh plumes, which adds consistency especially for volatile compounds. Most modeling studies have used EFs based on the arithmetic mean of field measurement outcomes, stratified by biome, and taken from the EF compilations mentioned above. This approach cannot account for the variability in EFs within biomes, which can be substantial. In general, natural variability in fuel moisture, fuel geometry, topography, and wind speed causes variability in the ratio of biomass consumption by flaming and smoldering combustion [ Hely et al ., ; McMeeking et al ., ; Chen et al ., ]. This, coupled with variations in chemical composition of the fuel, leads to a substantial range in the naturally occurring EFs for different species and fire types [ Akagi et al ., ]. This variability is usually not taken into account in large‐scale emission estimates except for variations due to vegetation type. In addition to the lack of representation in spatiotemporal variability, the often‐used averaged EFs may have limitations because it is not known whether they are based on a representative sample for various biomes [ van Leeuwen and van der Werf , ]. To assess the temporal variability of EFs, Korontzi et al . [ , ] conducted field measurements in African grassland fires over one fire season. Relatively high CO and CH 4 EFs were found in the beginning of the dry season, and lower EFs were measured toward the end of the dry season. Similar types of studies in southern Africa supported these findings [ Hoffa et al ., ; Korontzi et al ., ; Korontzi , ]. A study of Meyer et al . [ ] found no evidence for a significant seasonality in CH 4 EFs in Australian bushfires but indicated that variation in EFs across vegetation and fuel types is substantial and needs to be considered in emission assessments. The latter was confirmed by Wooster et al . [ ], who conducted measurements in late dry season fires in southern Africa: a range of 68–127 g kg −1 for CO EF was found for burning plots containing different proportions of savanna fuel types. So far, only a few regional emissions modeling studies considered seasonal and/or spatial variability of EFs. Hoffa et al . [ ] and Korontzi [ ] used the proportion of green grass biomass to total (green + dead) grass biomass to model fire emissions in southern African savannas. Partly building on the work of Hoffa et al . [ ], Ito and Penner [ ] applied three different methods for determining EFs to estimate CO emissions from open BB in southern Africa. All studies demonstrated that regional emission estimate outcomes were dependent on the variable EFs used: differences in fire CO emission estimates over 50% were found when comparing seasonally variable EFs versus fixed EFs [ Korontzi , ]. The impact of fuel type–specific CH 4 EFs in Australian bushfires was shown by Meyer et al . [ ], who compared the use of one single EF for CH 4 with EFs specified for separate fuel types in a sensitivity analysis. Introducing a separate EF for smoldering logs resulted in a 15% increase of total emissions over 2003–2009. On the other hand, an emission reduction of 21% was found when assigning a separate EF for fine logs. Here we developed six EF scenarios for CO using different methods to model their spatial and temporal variability. The scenarios were implemented in a bottom‐up modeling framework, and the resulting emissions were transported with the TM5 atmospheric tracer model. We focus on CO but because its EF correlates reasonably well with several other trace gases and aerosols, this work can be expanded to other species. We show results for the years 2002–2007 to capture multiple anomalous BB events including large boreal fires in Siberia and Alaska in 2003 and 2004 and high fire episodes in the Cerrados (savannas) and deforestation regions of Brazil in 2007. The focus on this time period allowed for a comparison with several recently published inversions as well. Our main objective was to understand the impact of spatial and temporal variability in EFs on large‐scale emission assessments and provide the CO modeling community with new information on the construction and use of EF scenarios in BB emission estimates. Methods An overview of the modeling framework that was used to estimate bottom‐up emissions of CO is given in . We transported the CO emission fields using the TM5 atmospheric transport model, which is further explained in . In , we describe the flask observations and satellite‐based measurements that were used in the model‐data comparison. Bottom‐Up Emission Estimates of CO Bottom‐up fire emissions were taken from the Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED3: Giglio et al ., ; van der Werf et al ., ). The data set consists of 0.5° × 0.5° monthly fields of burned area, fuel loads, combustion completeness, and fire C losses. Fire emissions were estimated based on burned area [ Giglio et al ., ], and the satellite driven Carnegie‐Ames‐Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model was used to calculate fuel loads and combustion completeness [ van der Werf et al ., ]. CASA calculates for every grid cell and every time step C pools, based on C input from net primary production and C losses through heterotrophic respiration, herbivory, fuelwood collection and fires. More details on the modeling framework can be found in van der Werf et al . [ ]. The focus of this study is on the conversion of C losses into different trace gas emissions, in our case CO. In the subparagraphs below, a description is given of the different EF scenarios we applied in this study, which are summarized in Table . GFED‐A&M GFED‐ Andreae and Merlet [ ] (abbreviated as GFED‐A&M in the remainder of the paper) corresponds to the EF scenario that was used in GFED3 [ van der Werf et al ., ]: Biome‐averaged EFs, compiled by Andreae and Merlet [ ] and updated annually by M.O. Andreae (2011, personal communication) were derived from measurements of fires in tropical forest, savanna and grassland, extratropical forest, tropical peat, and agricultural area. For tropical peat burning in Indonesia only one measurement [ Christian et al ., ] was used to estimate the CO EF, which was about twice as high as the EF for tropical forest fires. The average EF of tropical forest and savanna/grassland fires was applied to woodland fires because they represent a mixture of these fire types. The extratropical forest biome consists of all EF measurements made in the boreal and temperate zone. An overview of the CO EFs for the different biomes is given in Table . No temporal variability for the biome‐averaged EFs was taken into account in the GFED‐A&M scenario; e.g., a fire in the early dry season was given the same CO EF as a fire during the end of the dry season. GFED‐AKAGI The GFED‐ Akagi et al . [ ] (AKAGI) scenario followed a similar approach as GFED‐A&M but used biome‐averaged EF values of the more recent compilation of Akagi et al . [ ]. In contrast to the EF database of Andreae and Merlet [ ], Akagi et al . [ ] used EF measurements of “fresh” smoke plumes only. These fresh plumes have cooled to ambient temperature, but have not yet undergone significant photochemical processing. Since chemical disturbances are therefore neglected, they may allow for a better representation of the true regional initial emissions of a fire. This is not crucial for CO, but for more volatile gases, it may have a large impact on measured EFs. Besides a reduction in the amount of field studies used (Table ), the database of Akagi et al . [ ] also used a different and more extensive partitioning of EFs into different biomes. Selected EFs for landscape scale fires were organized into six types of vegetation: savanna, tropical forest, boreal forest, temperate forest, peatland, and chaparral. Thus, the category extratropical forest used by Andreae and Merlet [ ] was divided into boreal and temperate forest. Akagi et al . [ ] used a weighted average of boreal and temperate EFs (86.5% and 13.5%, respectively) for extratropical forest fires, based on GFED3 biomass consumption estimates [ van der Werf et al ., ]. For peatland EFs we made the following assumption: since the GFED modeling framework only takes peatlands in Indonesia into account, we excluded the peat measurements for boreal North America used by Akagi et al . [ ]. Therefore, the CO EF for peatland was based on one study for Indonesia, the same study that was used for the GFED‐A&M scenario. EF measurements in chaparral vegetation, a type of shrubland that is primarily found in California (US) and in the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula (Mexico), were used to define an average EF for this biome: In the 30°N–40°N, 70°W–55°W region, the savanna and grassland EFs were replaced by the biome‐averaged EFs values for chaparral, which are slightly higher (~6%) than those for the savanna and grassland biome. In the GFED‐AKAGI scenario, just like GFED‐A&M, no temporal variability for the biome‐averaged EFs was taken into account. ENVI‐A&M In addition to the spatial variability related to the distribution of different biomes, EFs may also show some degree of seasonal variation. During relatively moist conditions in the early fire season, the smoldering‐flaming ratio is expected to be higher, leading to higher CO EFs. On average, toward the end of the dry season, a decrease in fuel moisture may result in a more complete flaming combustion (well‐oxidized), resulting in lower CO EFs [ Hoffa et al ., ; Hely et al ., ; Korontzi et al ., , ]. This seasonal variation is not taken into account in the GFED‐A&M and GFED‐AKAGI scenarios, but we did include a temporal component in the ENVI‐A&M scenario described here. Only a few measurements of the seasonal variation of EFs are available, so we build on our previous modeling work to assess the seasonal variability of EFs for different biomes. Relations between EF measurements from the Andreae and Merlet [ ] database (including annual updates till 2011) and different measurements of environmental variables that may correlate with part of the variability in EFs—including fraction tree cover (FTC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), mean annual precipitation, mean monthly precipitation, mean annual temperature, mean monthly temperature, and the length of the dry season—were explored in van Leeuwen and van der Werf [ ]. To assess what fraction of the variability in CO EF measurements was correlated with coarse‐resolution global environmental data sets, we applied linear regressions between the CO EF values and environmental parameters corresponding to the EF measurement locations (Table ). We refer the reader to van Leeuwen and van der Werf [ ] for a more extensive description of the different environmental data sets used and the statistical methods that were applied. Global CO EF fields with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° and a temporal resolution of 1 month were estimated by combining all environmental data sets in a multivariate regression equation for CO ( r = 0.53, F = 89.9) with the data sets ranked in order of importance. _placeholder_formula_ Note that data sets with low correlations coefficients ( r < 0.1) were included in the multivariate regression, but automatically played a minor role in the equation. CO EF fields for peatlands in equatorial Asia were given the same values as the GFED‐A&M scenario, since EF measurements from peat were not taken into account in the linear regressions; peatlands showed often very high CO EF values that were not related to any of the environmental parameters described above and were outliers in the equation. ENVI‐AKAGI In the ENVI‐AKAGI scenario, we made the same assumptions as for ENVI‐A&M, but we now used the EF data set of Akagi et al . [ ] to find relations between CO EFs and the different environmental parameters (Table ). The lower number of measurements led to a somewhat different equation but again NDVI ( r = 0.48, F = 30.2) and FTC ( r = 0.40, F = 19.6) were contributing the most to the EF variability. The multivariate regression equation used to calculate the global CO EF fields ( r = 0.53, F = 40.7) is: _placeholder_formula_ For reasons explained in , we used the same CO EF values for peatlands in equatorial Asia as in the GFED‐AKAGI scenario. Modified Combustion Efficiency (MCE)‐STATIC The MCE‐STATIC scenario differs from the first four scenarios, and is together with MCE‐SEASON (section 2.1.6) the most experimental. CO EFs were estimated using the Modified Combustion Efficiency (MCE), defined as the fraction of molar‐based CO 2 and CO emissions that is emitted as CO 2 [ Ward et al ., ; Ferek et al ., ]. The MCE is useful to indicate the relative amount of flaming and smoldering combustion during a fire, and different fuel types are assumed to have different MCEs. Laboratory experiments have shown that MCE ranges from near 0.99 for flaming combustion to ∼ 0.65–0.85 for smoldering combustion [ Yokelson et al ., ], although in general, smoldering combustion has an MCE of about 0.8 [ Akagi et al ., ]. Following the findings of Meyer et al . [ ] that variation in EFs across fuel types is important, we predefined MCEs for seven different fuel types: wood, coarse woody debris, leaves, grasses, litter, soil C, and peat based on literature data when available. Note that this distinguishes the MCE approach from the others. An overview of the fraction of C that is combusted by each of these specific fuel types is shown in Figure . The GFED modeling framework indicates substantial variability in the contribution of the different fuel types; in boreal regions, soil C contributes most to emissions in the model, while litter is the largest contributor in midlatitude forests and savannas. Wood only dominates (sub)tropical forests. Fuel type–specific MCEs reported in the literature vary to a large degree, and in Table , an overview is given of the literature. The MCEs we used in the MCE‐STATIC scenario were grid cell specific but did not change seasonally. We aimed to define an MCE that was typically found during the end of the local dry season, the period of the year where in many regions of the world, fire emissions are highest. Since wood as in standing trees in general does not burn but is mostly a fuel component in deforestation regions, where it is often cut, dried, and then burned, we assumed wood to have the same MCE as coarse woody debris (CWD), which includes large logs and branches. The MCE for both fuel types was set to 0.89. Higher MCEs are normally found for fuel types with a larger surface to volume ratio, like grasses, leaves, and litter, including small twigs, branches, and downed leaves. Leaves—still attached to the tree or shrub—were given an MCE of 0.92, and grasses a slightly higher MCE (0.95). Litter often shows a large range in MCEs, and we set the value to 0.96 thought to correspond to an end of the dry season value. Soil C, including the duff layer, is assumed to burn more in the smoldering phase and thus with a lower MCE (0.85). Since peat is only defined in GFED3 in equatorial Asia, we used the measurements of Christian et al . [ ] to set an MCE of 0.83 for the burning of peat. Using these predefined MCEs for each fuel type, we developed global and monthly variable MCE fields by weighing the MCEs of the different fuel types in each grid cell by their relative contribution to total emissions. Since the MCE indicates the relative amount of flaming and smoldering combustion, it often correlates well with EFs of other trace gases and aerosols [ Yokelson et al ., ; Janhaell et al ., ]. According to the EF database of Andreae and Merlet [ ], based on 186 measurements conducted in different biomes, the following relation between MCE and CO EF exists: _placeholder_formula_ According to the EF database of Akagi et al . [ ], based on 104 measurements, this relation is: _placeholder_formula_ These equations are very similar, and differences between CO EF fields when using equations () and () were negligible. We used equation to estimate global and monthly variable CO EF fields, because it was derived from a larger sample of measurements. MCE‐SEASON Instead of defining a specific MCE as in MCE‐STATIC, in the MCE‐SEASON scenario we assumed MCE to vary between a set minimum and maximum MCE for the different fuel types. The MCE was scaled within this predefined range following a similar approach that is used in GFED to scale the combustion completeness based on the difference between potential evapotranspiration and monthly precipitation as a proxy for the dryness of the fuel. An overview of literature used to define MCE ranges for MCE‐SEASON is given in Table , and these were used to set the MCE: Wood and CWD were given the same MCE range starting at 0.83 (wet) to 0.90 (dry). For leaves that are still attached to the tree or shrub, we defined a range of 0.88–0.93. The range for grasses was set slightly higher following published values (Table ), with a minimum of 0.90 and a maximum of 0.96. Litter has a large range in MCE with values of ~0.80 in boreal areas for pure smoldering fires (R.J. Yokelson, personal communication 2011). We set the range to 0.86–0.97 to reflect the large variability, although we set the minimum higher to account for the fact that fires are rarely 100% smoldering. Soil C was given a minimum and maximum MCE value of 0.80 and 0.86, respectively, and for peat a range of 0.81–0.85 was defined to add a seasonal variation to the emissions. Similar to the approach used in CASA to model combustion completeness, we included some degree of memory by not just taking environmental conditions of the month when fires occurred but we also took the conditions in the previous month into account. These contributions (%) for the different fuel types can be found in Table . We assumed that wood and CWD were more affected by previous month's conditions since these fuel types are coarser and require more time to dry. Therefore, the contribution of previous month's MCE was set to 40%. Leaves, grasses, and litter have a larger surface to volume ratio and are therefore less affected by previous environmental conditions; these fuel types can dry relatively easy and were given a contribution of 10%. For soil C and peat, these effects were assumed to be larger, up to 30%. Although we acknowledge that both MCE‐SEASON and MCE‐STATIC scenarios are highly experimental and heavily based on expert judgments, we feel that it presents an alternative to the other scenarios with some appealing features that are based on our (limited) understanding of burning dynamics. In addition, this approach can be relatively easily ingested in emissions modeling frameworks. TM5 Atmospheric Transport Model To simulate atmospheric CO column mixing ratios, we transported the GFED CO emissions—based on the different EF scenarios—through the atmosphere using the TM5 tracer model [ Krol et al ., ; Huijnen et al ., ]. TM5 is an offline model driven by 3‐hourly meteorological fields from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), using ECMWF Re‐Analysis (ERA)‐Interim meteorological fields on a subset of 25 of the originally 60 hybrid ECMWF layers. The model runs on a coarse 2° × 3° (latitude × longitude) horizontal grid and deviates from the typical full chemistry version by using only a subset of the available chemistry to calculate CO distributions efficiently. We used a simplified CO‐OH chemistry scheme in which the hydroxyl radical (OH) is prescribed based on a rescaling (with a factor 0.92) of the Spivakovsky et al . [ ] distributions to match methylchloroform decay rates [ Huijnen et al ., ] and with CO + OH loss rates as in Huijnen et al . [ ]. The removal of CO by dry deposition is included, as well as production of CO from the oxidation of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and CH 4 [ Hooghiemstra et al ., , , ]. We applied monthly mean CO emissions for four different categories: (1) anthropogenic (combustion of fossil and biofuels) emissions were taken from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR4.1, compiled for the year 2004) [ EDGAR Project Team , ]. (2) The natural source consisted of direct emissions from plants and oceans [ Houweling et al ., ] and also the contribution of NMVOC‐CO. (3) Optimized CH 4 mixing ratio fields [ Bergamaschi et al ., ] were used to take the CO production from oxidation of CH 4 into account. The last source (4) was BB, taken from GFED with the six different EF scenarios implemented. All sources except BB were kept the same in the different model runs. To make sure that atmospheric CO reached a quasi steady state mixing ratio for 2002–2007, we spun up for 2 years (starting at January 2000). With these sources and sinks defined, the CO budget closely resembles the one used in the a priori scenarios in the inverse study of Hooghiemstra et al . [ ]. Observations of CO Surface flask observations of CO from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) Cooperative Air Sampling Network (downloaded from in November 2011) were used for comparison with our transported bottom‐up emissions. Currently, the NOAA/ESRL surface network consists of over 50 surface stations worldwide at which CO mixing ratios are weekly measured with very high analytical precision using flask samples [ Novelli et al ., , ]. Besides surface flask observations, we used CO total columns measurements from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument onboard NASA's Terra satellite. The MOPITT version 4 (V4) product [ Deeter et al ., ] is based on the retrieval of CO in the thermal‐infrared (TIR) at a wavelength of 4.7 mm [ Deeter , ], and columns are mainly sensitive to CO in the free troposphere (altitudes of ~4–7 km). Although there is currently also a MOPITT version 5 (V5) product based on retrieved CO columns in both the TIR and the near‐infrared, which is sensitive to CO in the boundary layer as well, we decided not to use this product in the current study since it is still considered “beta”‐grade. However, a fully validated version of this V5 product will be very worthwhile to explore in the near future. Here we used the daily MOPITTV4 data product, gridded at a 1° × 1° resolution, and applied the corresponding averaging kernel matrix to compare our modeled CO mixing ratios with individual measurements from MOPITT. We subsequently analyzed the results on a monthly basis over the years 2003–2006. Results A description of the modeled bottom‐up emission fields for the different EF scenarios is given in . The modeled atmospheric CO mixing ratios are presented in , and a comparison of our results, using both observed CO mixing ratios and recent inverse modeling results from other studies, is detailed in . Modeled CO Emission Fields Significant differences were found in mean annual CO emission estimates for the six EF scenarios, and across different regions in the world (Table and Figure ). Large variations occurred in the boreal regions, with on average higher annual CO emissions compared to GFED3 (currently using the GFED‐A&M scenario) for boreal North America and boreal Asia. Of all EF scenarios, MCE‐SEASON showed the largest increase for both regions; almost 40% more CO emissions were estimated in boreal North America for the 2002–2007 period, while in boreal Asia, the difference with GFED‐A&M was even higher (~50%). The continent of Africa, contributing up to 43% of the global CO emissions over 2002–2007, showed lower CO emissions in all of our new scenarios; both Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) Africa decreased on average with ~3.5% annually. In SH South America, a range in emissions of 58–69 Tg CO yr −1 was found for the different EF scenarios, and the mean (65 Tg CO) was more than 3% higher than GFED‐A&M. A large relative difference (on average an ~17% decrease compared to GFED‐A&M) was observed in the Middle East, but this region only contributes ~0.1% of global CO emissions. Spatial differences were also found within regions (Figure ). Comparing ENVI‐A&M, MCE‐STATIC, and MCE‐SEASON with the standard GFED3 run (GFED A&M), we observed higher CO emissions in tropical forested areas of NH Africa, SH Africa and SH South America, and lower values for savannas and grasslands in these regions. Overall emissions for NH and SH Africa decreased (Table and Figure ) due to the relative large contribution of savanna and grassland fires. In general, we observed more spatial homogeneity within the boreal regions. Besides spatial differences, the EF scenarios also led to new and variable temporal patterns. In Figure , the mean seasonal cycle of CO emissions is shown for eight important fire regions. Peak fire months (PFM) for GFED‐A&M (Figure , top left panel) usually occur in the local dry season in the tropics and the warmest months in the boreal region. For SH South‐America and SH Africa, this was August and September, while in NH Africa, the months of December and January showed the highest fire emissions. In SH Africa, we observed higher emissions for the ENVI‐AKAGI scenario in the early and late fire season, while CO emissions during the PFM were lower compared to GFED‐A&M. Other scenarios, like MCE‐STATIC and MCE‐SEASON, showed more consistency during the season with lower emissions in SH Africa for all fire months. MCE‐SEASON also estimated lower emissions during the PFM in equatorial Asia, but now, the other months showed higher emissions. For Boreal Asia and ENVI‐AKAGI, this pattern was reversed, with higher emissions in the PFM and lower emissions during the rest of the year. Overall, the new EF scenarios led to substantially different spatial and temporal patterns from a bottom‐up CO emission perspective. Modeled Atmospheric CO Mixing Ratios Transport of bottom‐up CO emission fields into the atmosphere with the TM5 model resulted in different atmospheric mixing ratios for the EF scenarios. The largest departure compared to the GFED standard runs were found for the MCE‐SEASON scenario, shown in Figure . In the upper panel, the mean monthly CO mixing ratio enhancement due to BB is shown for GFED‐A&M, clearly demonstrating the transport of CO to regions downwind of the fire source regions. In the lower panel, the difference between MCE‐SEASON and GFED‐A&M is shown. Most of the NH had higher CO burdens in MCE‐SEASON, while the African continent showed lower mixing ratios than GFED‐A&M. Typical differences found between both scenarios were 10–20 ppb, corresponding to ~35% of the GFED‐A&M CO in the boreal areas and roughly ~10% in African fire hotspots. This difference in the NH and tropical mixing ratios was largest for MCE‐SEASON, but also found in other scenarios as shown in Figure where large‐scale north‐south gradients were plotted for the different EF scenarios. Instead of yearly averages, results are now shown for the months of June, July, August, and September only, since these months captured most of the fires in the boreal regions, southern Africa, Indonesia, and South America. Note that BB in northern Africa, clearly visible as a hot spot in Figure , is not very pronounced here since typical PFMs for that region are December and January. Moreover, the longitudinal averaging dampens the tropical signals because emissions occur only over the land regions that cover a smaller fraction of the tropics than the high northern latitudes. This averaging may also cancel large spatial differences across the tropical latitudes: e.g., MCE‐SEASON estimated an increase of emissions above South‐America (Figure , lower panel), but this difference is partly canceled by the lower emissions for the continent of Africa. The largest differences in mean latitudinal mixing ratios (~15 ppb) were found in the NH, where MCE‐STATIC, MCE‐SEASON, and GFED‐AKAGI showed an increase compared to mixing ratios of GFED‐A&M. Around the equator, GFED‐A&M showed the highest mixing ratios, and in the SH, most scenarios agreed well. To investigate whether the new scenarios led to a temporal shift in peak CO mixing ratio, we plotted time series for three important fire regions in Figure . Large differences up to 30 ppb were observed in boreal North America during the months of June, July, and August, corresponding to an increase of ~40% compared to GFED3 estimates. In SH Africa, differences were the largest during the end of the dry season (corresponding to a decrease up to ~15% compared to GFED3 estimates), but we also found variations during the beginning of the dry season (May–July) for the years 2004 and 2005 (~15 ppb). In SH South America, the differences were not as pronounced, although deviations up to ~17 ppb were found during the end of the dry season in 2005. Overall, the temporal differences in the EF scenarios seem to be of the same magnitude as the spatial differences, with distinct month‐to‐month and even year‐to‐year variations in modeled CO mixing ratios. This suggests that in the interpretation of observed CO mixing ratios, the attribution of the CO growth rate to BB will depend again on the EF scenario assumed. Comparison to Observed Atmospheric CO Mixing Ratios We used the NOAA surface stations that were most representative for important regions from a CO fire emission perspective. To choose these stations, we plotted the range of CO mixing ratios for the different EF scenarios estimates in every TM5 model grid cell (Figure ). In the upper panel—corresponding to the lower atmosphere (1000–800 hPa)—we observed the largest differences (up to 40 ppb) in Alaska, Siberia, Africa, and South America. Most stations are in the NH and few in the BB‐dominated parts of the tropics and SH. The two stations that are most affected by BB with departures up to 20 pbb are Barrow Alaska (BRW) and Ascension Island (ASC). BRW was chosen to represent boreal fires of North America, and due to long‐range transport, the station may capture CO from fires in boreal Asia as well. ASC is located in the Atlantic Ocean between Africa and South America. Since IAV in observed CO mixing ratios is relatively small [ Hooghiemstra et al ., ], the enhancement of CO over ASC was assumed to come mainly from emissions in Africa where the IAV in BB CO is less pronounced compared to South America [ Torres et al ., ; van der Werf et al ., ]. In general, the modeled atmospheric mixing ratios followed the seasonal cycle of CO measurements well for BRW (Figure ), although an underestimation of ~15–20 ppb existed similar to the findings of Hooghiemstra et al . [ ]. This underestimation of modeled CO versus observations is a common bias in the boreal NH (as further discussed in ), and instead of interpreting this offset, we will therefore mostly focus on the temporal changes of the model and the measurements. The highest CO mixing ratios were observed from November to April, mainly due to anthropogenic sources. BB peaked in this region during May–August, and this is the period where we observed the largest differences between the EF‐derived mixing ratios. Although GFED‐AKAGI, MCE‐STATIC, and MCE‐SEASON showed higher CO mixing ratios than GFED‐A&M and hence compared better with NOAA measurements, the differences between the EF scenarios were not large enough to conclude that the atmospheric observations of CO lend credibility to one EF scenario relative to the others: the temporal correlation coefficients ( r ) over the years 2002–2007 were in the 0.81–0.82 range for all EF scenarios. For ASC, the highest CO mixing ratios were observed from August to October, mainly due to BB in Africa and South America. Here the seasonal cycle was also captured reasonably well, although an underestimation of ~20 ppb existed mainly at the end of the dry season. Nevertheless, none of the EF scenarios improved the match with CO measurements from NOAA, suggesting that the atmospheric surface network, targeted mostly at relatively clean background conditions, is not well positioned to constrain BB plumes. In addition to the ground‐based measurements, we used satellite observations of the MOPITT instrument to compare with our modeled mixing ratios above regions where BB played an important role. Five different areas were defined within the main BB regions in which relatively large differences between our modeled EF scenarios can be found, both at the surface and at heights at which the satellite measurements have the highest sensitivity (Figure , lower panel). Time series of the modeled CO mixing ratios and MOPITT observations for the different regions in the years 2003–2006 are shown in Figure . The largest differences between the EF scenarios were found for regions 1 and 2, located within respectively boreal NH and Asia. Although the seasonal cycle is captured relatively well, an underestimation of ~15 ppb compared to MOPITT existed. The temporal correlation coefficients over the years 2003–2006 indicated that MCE‐SEASON performed best for regions 1 and 2 (Table ): correlations of 0.91 with MOPITT were found, while ENVI‐AKAGI was significantly lower (0.84 and 0.83 for regions 1 and 2, respectively). Located within the Brazilian Amazon, region 3 showed differences between the EF scenarios of up to ~8 ppb during the fire season, while the underestimation of our modeled results compared to MOPITT is substantially larger (up to ~60 ppb in the year 2004). During the burning season, MOPITT measurements also peaked 1 month later than our modeled mixing ratios, similar to the findings of Hooghiemstra et al . [ ] in this region. For all monthly CO observations over the 2003–2006 period, the highest correlations were found for ENVI‐AKAGI (0.87). Similar to region 3, the maximum differences between the different EF scenarios in Africa (region 4) were ~8 ppb and in general MOPITT is about 15 ppb higher during the end of the burning. Moreover, our modeled mixing ratios peaked one to two months earlier than MOPITT observations. The correlation coefficients differed less pronouncedly and are in a range of 0.83–0.84 for all scenarios, indicating that none of the EF scenarios improved the temporal variations of the mixing ratios. Within region 5 (EQAS), the model output followed MOPITT estimates relatively well, although a slight underestimation was found for the months of August and September and an overestimation for January to March in the years 2003–2005. None of the EF scenarios clearly improved the temporal correlation (Table ). As an alternative to both types of observations, we compared our results to recent inversion studies that often used atmospheric measurements in combination with satellite‐derived CO columns to constrain the emissions. Our focus was on the year 2004, and we assumed that BB burning played a major role in the total emission estimates for the different regions of interest. In general, we found that most EF scenarios were in line with other inversion studies for boreal North America (Table ): higher CO mixing ratios than GFED3 (using the GFED‐A&M scenario) were suggested by all inversion studies and most of the EF scenarios, except for ENVI‐A&M and ENVI‐AKAGI. Pison et al . [ ] inverted emissions of CO, CH 4 , and H 2 simultaneously over South America, using observations from NOAA and found lower CO emissions. GFED‐AKAGI supported this finding. ENVI‐A&M was in close agreement with GFED‐A&M, while the other EF scenarios suggested more CO for this region. For Africa, most inverse modeling studies, except Chevallier et al . [ ] who performed a detailed analysis of African CO emissions using MOPITT data, suggested higher CO emissions than estimated by GFED3. However, three out of five EF scenarios showed a decrease in CO above Africa. For Australia the results were mixed as well: MCE‐STATIC and MCE‐SEASON showed a decrease in CO, and the same holds for the inverse modeling studies of Hooghiemstra et al . [ ] and Pison et al . [ ]. Using satellite data from two and three different instruments, respectively, both Jones et al . [ ] and Kopacz et al . [ ] suggested an increase of CO over the Australian continent. This was confirmed by ENVI‐AKAGI only. Discussion Impact of Different EF Scenarios New EF emission fields impacted atmospheric concentrations globally, most pronounced over the African continent and boreal Alaska and Siberia. Focusing on the boreal regions, we showed CO mixing ratios varying up to 30 ppb in boreal North America in 2003 and 2004 (Figure ), corresponding to an increase of ~40% compared to GFED3 estimates. Both 2003 and 2004 were high fire years due to climatic conditions, and especially the fires that burned from June through September 2004 were the largest on record for Alaska [ Pfister et al ., ]. The year 2003 saw high fire rates in Siberian forests as well due to a precipitation deficit during the period from August 2002 to May 2003 in the region [ Huang et al ., ]. Thick haze caused by this fire event covered large parts of the boreal Asia for weeks, with smoke plumes travelling completely around the globe [ Bertschi and Jaffe , ]. Like for boreal North America, the different EF scenarios showed an increase in CO mixing ratios compared to GFED3 for boreal Asia. The uncertainty in boreal fire emission estimates is large due to difficulties in modeling the consumption of the organic soil as the most important factor in governing emissions [ French et al ., ]. The large ranges of EF‐derived CO mixing ratios we found for boreal fires in 2003 and 2004 suggest that the contribution of EFs to this uncertainty is substantial and may therefore explain part of the underestimation of CO emission estimates by GFED that was found by Yurganov et al . [ ], Huijnen et al . [ ], and Krol et al . [ ] for the intensive Russian wildfires in 2010. The contribution of uncertainty in EFs to total uncertainty of the estimated CO budget will likely also impact assessment of other CO sources. Emissions of fossil fuel burning and the CO production from NMVOC emissions are often adapted in inverse modeling studies to match observations of CO (e.g., Hooghiemstra et al ., ), and the different EF scenarios will likely lead to new results. A recent inversion study by Hooghiemstra et al . [ ], based on GFED3 and thus the GFED‐A&M scenario, required more BB emissions from South America to match MOPITT CO columns. Our simulations suggest that the use of any of the alternative EF scenarios would enhance the mismatch, since these EF scenarios produce even lower CO mixing ratios than GFED‐A&M at heights where MOPITT is most sensitive (Figure , lower panel). On the other hand, choosing an alternative EF scenario would then also reduce CO mixing ratios in Africa and trigger a need for more BB emissions from this continent to compare well with MOPITT. Clearly, the impact of using different EF scenarios is likely to be substantial but complex. Which EF Scenario? We consider MCE‐SEASON as the most promising EF scenario of all, especially if we get a better handle on the fuel type partitioning in GFED and their corresponding MCE ranges. Assigning MCEs to specific fuel types allows us to better capture the variation within biomes: specifically accounting for the fraction of emissions stemming from litter and soil C may be useful in the boreal areas since the role of organic consumption is now taken into account. Within the savanna and grassland biome, the contribution of CWD could be important in separating woody from grassy vegetation. Moreover, the MCE scenario may be useful for the conversion to other trace gases and aerosols because they are directly linked to MCE. However, MCE‐STATIC and MCE‐SEASON are also the most experimental scenarios that need more validation. Focusing on EF scenarios where no temporal variability was included—MCE‐STATIC, GFED‐A&M, and GFED‐AKAGI—the latter is the most useful for EFs of volatile compounds due to the focus on “fresh” plume measurements, and therefore allowing for a better representation of true initial conditions of a fire. Although this is not specifically important for CO, the uniform sampling protocol for EF measurements that was used by Akagi et al . [ ] may be an advantage over the use of EFs from Andreae and Merlet [ ], who took the mean of all EF measurements. Moreover, the spatial variation is larger in GFED‐AKAGI than GFED‐A&M due to the definition of three extra biomes, which may do justice to the differences between temperate and boreal fire characteristics. We are confident that EF scenarios that include a seasonal component (ENVI‐A&M, ENVI‐AKAGI, and MCE‐SEASON) are more realistic than the ones that do not have this component, but we cannot assess whether the degree to which we model EF seasonality is right. In many BB regions, a strong seasonal cycle for different environmental parameters was found, with distinct dry seasons of low moisture and high temperatures toward the end of the dry season in, e.g., EQAS and SH South America. However, the exact relations between EFs and these environmental parameters are hard to constrain, both from a bottom‐up and top‐down perspective. As a first attempt to understand whether atmospheric observations of CO in the troposphere lend credibility to one or more EF scenarios relative to the others, we compared our results with NOAA station measurements. The range of our EF derived mixing ratios for NOAA station locations was relatively small compared to BB regions in Africa, South America, and the boreal NH (Figure , upper panel), and although our modeled simulations captured the seasonal variation quite well for most of the stations, none of the EF scenarios improved the match with CO measurements. The mismatch between modeled and observed mixing ratios may be partly explained by the use of unoptimized emissions, as well as the existence of several limitations of the station data for evaluating BB emissions [ Bian et al ., ]. Especially in the boreal regions, an underestimation of CO by atmospheric transport models is common: Mao et al ., argued that OH levels in the NH might be too high in many of the models and estimated that a decrease of OH concentrations drives an annual mean increase of model CO concentrations by 20–30 ppb. This increase of CO may explain a substantial part of the underestimation that we found for our modeled results and also largely corrects the bias for GEOS‐CHem [ Alvarado et al ., ; Fisher et al ., ; Kopacz et al ., ] and several other model [ Shindell et al ., ] simulations in the boreal NH. Another potential source of bias are inaccurate emission estimates, and, e.g., Hooghiemstra et al . [ ] speculated that anthropogenic emissions in Asia were too low to reproduce the right CO concentrations for the NH. Since the different EF scenarios caused changes in CO mixing ratios up to 9 ppb at elevations where satellite sensors are sensitive (Figure , lower panel), we explored the use of CO column measurements derived from the MOPITT instrument. Similar to our comparison with NOAA stations, the observations from MOPITT indicated that the mismatch between modeled and observed was substantially larger than the differences found between the EF scenarios, with, in general, a negative bias (ratio model output to MOPITT) for most of the regions (Figure ). However, temporal correlations over the 2003–2006 period significantly improved for specific EF scenarios (Table ): in the boreal regions, the highest correlations were found for both MCE‐STATIC and MCE‐SEASON, indicating that the definition of fuel type–specific EFs might be important for fire emission modeling within these regions. Over South America and Indonesia, the influence of EF seasonality seemed to be important since the highest correlations (0.87 and 0.82, respectively) were found for ENVI‐AKAGI, the scenario that is driven by several environmental data sets. Comparing GFED‐A&M and GFED‐AKAGI, the two EF scenarios that used biome‐averaged EF and in which no seasonality is included, we found that the scenario relying on the EF database of Akagi et al . [ ] showed the best performance compared to MOPITT data in most of the regions. The uniform sampling protocol used for EF measurements and the definition of three extra EF specific biomes may have caused this better fit. As an alternative approach to rate the different EF scenarios, a quantitative comparison with recent inverse modeling studies for the year 2004 was made. This exercise yielded conflicting results and could not identify one EF scenario as superior over the others. Partly, this could be because these studies focused on slightly different regions and time periods, but it is also likely that the observations (both satellite derived and sampled from the atmosphere) simply do not yet have the resolving power to distinguish one EF scenario from another well enough. An interesting new opportunity for such inverse modeling studies is offered through our MCE approach: instead of optimizing BB emissions directly, the inverse models could try to optimize the MCEs of each fuel type, and thereby extrapolate “local” information from measurements directly influenced by burning to larger areas of the globe. Sources of Uncertainty Our work included many steps, each bearing uncertainties that are not always easily quantified. Below we qualitatively discuss the uncertainties related to the different EF scenarios. Focusing on the different scenarios we developed, both GFED‐A&M and GFED‐AKAGI used biome‐averaged EFs that did not change through the season. In addition to the assumption that EFs do not change from 1 month to the other, the definition of a specific biome carries uncertainty: Andreae and Merlet [ ] compiled EF measurements for four different biomes; extratropical forest, tropical forest, savanna and grassland, and agricultural area. The extratropical forest biome covers both boreal and temporal forests, although EFs for both vegetation types are likely to differ. Akagi et al . [ ] defined two additional biomes and separated the boreal and temperate forests. Using the same EF for specific biomes all over the world introduces another uncertainty: e.g., savanna fires in Australia are assumed to burn with the same CO EF as African savannas or Cerrado fires in Brazil. The same is true for tropical forest fires in Brazil, Mexico, and Africa, or boreal forest fires in Alaska and Siberia. In both ENVI‐A&M and ENVI‐AKAGI, a temporal variability in CO EFs was added, based on the assumption that the condition of the regional environment would correlate with the regional CO EF. Since our work is based on coarse 0.5° × 0.5° data sets and landscapes are often heterogeneous, the average environment for a large area will not correlate perfectly with the few available point measurements. Although reasonable correlations were found for specific case studies, the multivariate relations based on all the full suite of EF measurements of Andreae and Merlet [ ] and Akagi et al . [ ] were lower and explained ~28% of the variability for CO. This may be partly due to uncertainties in the EF measurements used and the different environmental data sets [ van Leeuwen and van der Werf , ]. Further, we noticed that the fire process is very complex, and the exact relationships between different burning conditions and the emissions are not well understood yet. Besides ambient conditions, other factors, like fuel density, fuel spacing, and an efficient heat transfer, play a large and complex role in the emissions, but this is very difficult to take into account in a coarse resolution model like GFED. For MCE‐STATIC and MCE‐SEASON, we used predefined MCEs for seven different fuel types, which is a novel way in the GFED modeling framework to calculate trace gas emissions. In addition to the assumption that the partitioning of different fuel types in the biogeochemical GFED‐CASA model is correct, data on how MCEs of specific fuel types evolve over time are limited, and in some cases, nonexisting. Because of this lack of data, the definition of specific MCEs for both scenarios is for some fuel types that are highly experimental and based on our own judgment. Although we acknowledge that a change in the fuel type–specific MCEs will impact emission estimates substantially, we feel that this scenario offers an interesting alternative to the other scenarios, and it will be explored further in future versions of GFED. Finally, even a “perfect” EF scenario depends on the calculation of bottom‐up C emissions. In the GFED modeling framework, C emission estimates for BB are basically based on three quantities—burned area, fuel loads, and combustion completeness—all bearing their own uncertainties. The main uncertainties for these quantities are described in , and for a more extensive description, we refer to van der Werf et al . [ , ]. In general, uncertainties in global fire C emissions are reducing due to improvement of the quality of the input data sets [ van der Werf et al ., ], but are still estimated to about 20% at an annual scale. Uncertainties increase when smaller regions or shorter time windows are considered. To improve our understanding of the impact of seasonal and temporal variable EFs on total CO emissions, we need to get a better handle on the uncertainties of the different quantities involved in the modeling framework. Sensitive experiments as conducted by Bian et al . [ ] provide useful information regarding these uncertainties. Overall, our new scenarios provided a physically plausible way forward, but addressing the uncertainty proved difficult. More ground measurements are needed to increase our knowledge on the partitioning of biomass burned in different trace gases and aerosols, with a focus on understanding temporal variations and the different drivers that affect EF variability. Following the work of Chen et al . [ ], an important step forward could be the setup of several lab experiments to test the role of different environmental parameters—like, e.g., soil moisture and temperature—on EFs for different vegetation types. Conclusions We developed new biomass burning emission factor (EF) scenarios for use in large‐scale fire emission assessments, including a component of spatial and temporal variability. These new scenarios were used to construct CO emission fields, which we transported into the atmosphere with the TM5 chemistry transport model. Our work demonstrated the potential importance of accounting for spatial and temporal variations of EFs in fire emission modeling, and new EF fields impacted emission estimates of CO considerably. Most of the EF scenarios suggested an increase of CO emission estimates in boreal regions compared to the GFED standard run with differences up to 50% for total CO emissions for the 2002–2007 period. Over the continent of Africa, lower values were estimated, with on average a total annual decrease of ~3.5%. The new emission fields also caused changes in corresponding atmospheric mixing ratios of CO. A range of 30 ppb over boreal North America was found between the various EF scenarios during the burning season, and for both Africa and South America, values varied over 15 ppb depending on the EF scenario. Our findings suggest that the choice of EF scenario can alter the interpretation of observed mixing ratios, such as in inverse studies, substantially. We consider the EF scenarios that included temporal variations more physically sound than static EF scenarios due to the substantial seasonality of different environmental parameters found in most biomass burning regions. However, exact relations between these parameters and the EFs cannot be extracted from the current body of literature. The Modified Combustion Efficiency (MCE), a measure for the relative amount of flaming and smoldering combustion during a fire, was used in a promising new method that is based on the definition of fuel type–specific MCEs. Unfortunately, remote surface observations of CO in the troposphere and recent inverse modeling studies did not lend credibility to one or more EF scenarios relative to the others. A satellite‐based comparison indicated that the choice of EF scenario might be region‐specific: in the boreal biomass burning regions, the fuel type–specific approach performed better, while including EF seasonality through environmental variables played a more important role in South America and Indonesia. The use of higher spatial and temporal resolution data could be an important next step in validating these regional differences between the various EF scenarios.

The convective activity over the WNP region displays pronounced interannual variability and has considerable impacts on the climate over East Asia [e.g., ]. El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been recognized as the primary factor which determines the interannual variability of the summer climate over the WNP and East Asia [e.g., ; ; ]. The climatic anomalies over the WNP are related to different phases of ENSO [e.g., ; ; ]. Precipitation anomalies over the WNP tend to be positive during El Niño developing years and negative during El Niño decaying years [ ]. The impacts of ENSO on the climate over the WNP region during its decaying summers attract more attention because of the significant signals and predictability of the WNP summer anomalies. Western North Pacific anticyclonic (WNPAC) anomalies, emerging in the El Niño mature winter and maintaining during the following spring and summer, are the crucial components in reflecting the relationship between El Niño and the WNP summer climate in the El Niño decaying summer [e.g., ; ; ; ; ]. The variations of the WNPAC anomalies are associated with differences in ENSO activity. The increased magnitude and periodicity of ENSO induce strengthened monsoon – ocean interaction over the WNP region, which makes the WNPAC anomalies last longer during the El Niño decaying summer [ ], and influences the precipitation pattern over East Asia [ ]. The increased ENSO amplitude also causes the enhancement of the air–sea interaction in the Indian Ocean. The positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean, following the wintertime El Niño events, contribute to the reinforcement of the WNPAC anomalies [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. In addition, coupled model results suggested that strong El Niño events, tending to be followed by short decaying phases, are in favor of the maintenance of the WNPAC anomalies from subsequent spring to summer [ ]. As an important feature of El Niño, the persistence of decaying phases, however, varies from case to case. This can be illustrated by the seasonal evolutions of El Niño events ( ). Here, a warm event is defined when the DJF (December–January–February)‐mean Niño 3 index (defined as the SST anomalies averaged over 5°S–5°N, 150–90°W) is larger than 0.8 standard deviation from the time mean. Under this criterion, the years 1951/52, 1957/58, 1965/66, 1972/73, 1976/77, 1982/83, 1986/87, 1991/92, 1994/95, 1997/98 and 2002/03 are chosen as 11 El Niño events from observations. shows that some El Niño events are followed by short decaying phases while other cases are followed by long decaying phases. This difference in the length of decaying phase leads to a wide spread among Niño 3 index values in the decaying summer JJA(1): the standard deviation of JJA(1) Niño 3 index values among the 11 cases is 0.72°C, which is comparable to that of the D(0)JF(1) Niño 3 index (0.83°C). hints that the impacts of El Niño in the mature winter on the following summer climatic anomalies over the WNP might depend on two features of El Niño: the intensity of wintertime El Niño and the length of the decaying phase. Some previous studies have indicated that these two features are related to each other, i.e., strong El Niño events tend to be followed by short decaying phases [ ; ; ]. suggested that strong El Niño events, being followed by short decaying phases, result in strong WNPAC anomalies in the summer. However, they did not separately evaluate the roles of wintertime intensity and the decaying phase of El Niño events. In this study, we attempt to assess the relative roles of these two features in affecting the WNP summer climatic anomalies. Since the observational record is too short and there are not enough events to be used to address this question, we turn to analyze the simulation results by a coupled atmosphere–ocean model and check the main conclusion by observational analysis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After a brief description of the model and data set in , the model results are analyzed in and : roles of the El Niño decaying phases in the relationship between El Niño and the WNP summer climate are illustrated in , and the impacts of El Niño intensity on the WNPAC anomalies are demonstrated by removing the influence of decaying phases in . In addition, observational evidence of the impacts of El Niño decaying phases is investigated in . Finally, a discussion and conclusions are presented in . Model and Experiment The model used in this study is a coupled atmosphere‐ocean GCM developed by the Hadley Centre, named as HadCM3. The atmospheric component of HadCM3 has 19 levels with a horizontal resolution of 2.5° of latitude by 3.75° of longitude [ ], and the oceanic component has 20 levels with a horizontal resolution of 1.25° by 1.25°. The coupled model run uses constant pre‐industrial trace gas concentrations and incoming solar radiation. The model has been integrated without flux adjustment for over 1000 years with stable climate [ ]. A 1000‐year simulation of this pre‐industrial run is analyzed in this study. The observational data used here are reconstructed monthly mean SST from 1948 to 2003 [ ], and monthly mean NECP/NCAR reanalysis data for the same period [ ]. One hundred and fifty‐two El Niño events are yielded in the 1000‐year pre‐industrial simulation, which are defined as the DJF‐mean Niño 3 index being larger than one standard deviation from the time mean. This criterion is similar to that used in observations. shows the composite seasonal evolution of El Niño events both in the model and observations. The model basically reproduces the amplitude, growth and decay of the warm events [e.g., ]. The positive SST anomalies develop around the preceding spring, labeled as MAM(0), grow over the next two seasons and reach their peak in the winter D(0)JF(1). After the mature winter, the positive SST anomalies weaken in the following spring MAM(1), and transfer to a normal state in the summer JJA(1). These features are consistent with the composite of 11 El Niño events in observations. evaluated the model's ability in simulating the anomalous anticyclones over the WNP and the south Indian Ocean associated with the different phases of ENSO. They suggested that the HadCM3 coupled model reproduces the climatological distribution of 850‐hPa wind over the WNP and precipitation in the tropical Pacific. Furthermore, the model captures the basic features of the WNPAC anomalies associated with ENSO phases: the WNPAC anomalies form in the previous autumn SON(0), reach their peak during the El Niño mature winter D(0)JF(1) and the following spring MAM(1), and decay rapidly in the subsequent summer JJA(1). Thus, the results simulated by this model can be used to analyze the impacts of El Niño behavior on the WNP summer climate. Roles of the El Niño Decaying Phases in the Relationship Between El Niño and WNP Summer Climate Impacts of the Length of El Niño Decaying Phases The 152 El Niño events in the 1000‐year pre‐industrial simulation are divided into two categories: short decaying and long decaying El Niño cases. The El Niño events for which the JJA(1) Niño 3 index is less (greater) than 0°C are classified as the short (long) decaying events. This criterion yields 84 short decaying and 68 long decaying El Niño cases. depicts the seasonal evolution of the Niño 3 index for the composite short and long decaying cases, respectively. These two kinds of El Niño both develop around the spring MAM(0) and peak in the winter D(0)JF(1) with similar strength. However, after the mature winter, the positive SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific decline faster and transform to negative SST anomalies in the summer JJA(1) for the short decaying events. On the other hand, the positive SST anomalies for the long decaying events maintain until the next winter D(1)JF(2). During the El Niño decaying summer JJA(1), the strength of the Niño 3 index is about 0.8°C for the long decaying events, which contrast sharply with −0.7°C for the short decaying ones. In addition, also implies that El Niño events with similar intensity can be followed by different decaying phases. The composite stream function anomalies for the short and long decaying events are shown in . The significant WNPAC anomalies associated with the short decaying cases ( ) in JJA(1) suggest that there is a significant relationship between short decaying El Niño events and ‐WNP summer climate. The center of the WNPAC anomalies in the mature winter D(0)JF(1) and following spring MAM(1) are located in the South China Sea, showing a slight‐ eastward shift with time, which is in agreement with previous studies [e.g., ; ]. For the long decaying events, the WNPAC anomalies in D(0)JF(1) and MAM(1) are roughly similar to those for the short decaying events. Although the WNPAC anomalies are weaker than those for short decaying events in D(0)JF(1) ( and ), they are very similar in MAM(1) ( and ). The most remarkable difference of the WNPAC anomalies between the short and long decaying events appears in JJA(1) ( and ). The significant WNPAC anomalies persist for the short decaying cases, while they disappear and even weak cyclonic anomalies emerge over the WNP region for the long decaying cases. This pronounced difference suggests that the El Niño events with short decaying phases, rather than with long decaying phases, have strong impacts on the WNP summer climate. In addition, a pair of cyclonic circulation anomalies over the central and eastern Pacific is found for both the short and long decaying cases, but the intensity is quite different. The strength of these cyclonic anomalies for the long decaying events is roughly twice that of the short decaying cases in D(0)JF(1) and MAM(1). This implies that the anomalous westerly flow over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific is stronger for the long decaying cases, which favors the persistence of positive SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific by suppressing the upwelling there. The El Niño‐related SST anomalies for the short and ‐ long decaying events are shown in . The different strengths of SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean in the mature winter are related to different lengths of decaying phases, even though the SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific are similar for the two categories of El Niño. The correlation coefficient between the D(0)JF(1) Indian Ocean SST anomalies averaged over the region (10°S–20°N, 40–110°E) and the JJA(1) Niño 3 index is −0.48, which indicates that the strong positive Indian Ocean SST anomalies in the mature winter are associated with the strong negative SST anomalies over the central and eastern tropical Pacific in the decaying summer. In D(0)JF(1), the Indian Ocean SST anomalies are significantly positive, with the regional averaged value of 0.42°C for the short decaying cases. Conversely, they are weak (with regional averaged value of 0.22) for the long decaying El Niño events. The impacts of wintertime Indian Ocean SST anomalies on the decline of El Niño have been proposed by , , and . Collectively, the work reported by these authors suggested that the strong positive Indian Ocean SST anomalies generate the easterly flow extending to the western equatorial Pacific by inducing an atmospheric Kelvin wave, which can be detected by the strong WNPAC anomalies in D(0)JF(1) ( ). During MAM(1), the anomalous easterly flow is enhanced and expanded to the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which weakens the cyclonic circulation in the central and eastern Pacific ( ), and leads to a decline of positive SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific ( ). In JJA(1), the positive SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific transform into negative anomalies, which indicates the rapid‐ decline of El Niño events. This short maintenance of the El Niño decaying phase is contributed to by the anomalous easterly flow over the equatorial Pacific, induced by the significantly positive Indian Ocean SST anomalies in the mature winter. Unlike the short decaying cases, in D(0)JF(1), the Indian Ocean SST anomalies are insignificant for the long decaying El Niño events ( ), even though they both have similar strength SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. The insignificant Indian Ocean SST anomalies hardly influence the wind anomalies over the equatorial Pacific, so the WNPAC anomalies are weaker in D(0)JF(1) and the cyclonic anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific are stronger in MAM(1) than those for short decaying cases. The strong westerly flow over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific associated with the strong cyclonic circulation weakens the easterly trade winds and leads to a long decaying of El Niño. Thus the positive SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific still persist in JJA(1) ( ). The SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean in the mature winter affect the length of El Niño decaying phase through modifying the wind anomalies over the equatorial Pacific. The wintertime intensity of Indian Ocean SST anomalies is a precursor to the different lengths of El Niño decaying phases. It should be mentioned that the different Indian Ocean SST anomalies in the mature winter corresponding to the short and long decaying cases are related to the similar strength of wintertime El Niño. This implies that the warming in the Indian Ocean is not only a part of the El Niño signal [e.g., ; ], but also relates to the dynamic processes over the Indian Ocean [ ; ; ]. Furthermore, the circulation anomalies over the WNP in the El Niño decaying summer JJA(1) for the short and long decaying cases are related to the simultaneous SST anomalies. For the short decaying cases, the strong WNPAC anomalies shown in are associated with the configurations of SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and in the central and eastern tropical Pacific ( ). On the one hand, the negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific are in favor of a pair of anticyclonic circulation anomalies on the western side according to the Gill's theoretical model; but on the other hand, previous studies have indicated that the positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean contribute to the persistence of the WNPAC anomalies [e.g., ; ]. suggested that the warm SSTs in the Indian Ocean excite a warm Kelvin wave into the western Pacific, inducing surface wind divergence and suppressing convection over the WNP region, therefore strengthening the WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer. Thus, both the SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific and in the Indian Ocean contribute to the persistence of the WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer for the short decaying El Niño events [ ]. In addition, some previous studies emphasized the role of the WNPAC anomalies in terminating El Niño events and triggering La Niña events through the anomalous easterly wind south of the WNPAC anomalies [e.g., ; ; ; ]. Our results further suggest that the short decaying of El Niño is also in favor of the WNPAC anomalies, which might imply a strong interaction between El Niño and the WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer. For the long decaying El Niño events, the WNPAC anomalies disappear and tend to be cyclonic anomalies in JJA(1) ( ). These cyclonic circulation anomalies might be the response to the positive SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, even though the weak positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean have some roles in the WNPAC anomalies. The effects of SST anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific overwhelm those in the Indian Ocean, and induce the cyclonic circulation anomalies over the WNP. In short, the positive SST anomaly in the Indian Ocean and negative SST anomaly in the central and eastern tropical Pacific work constructively for the short decaying cases, while the positive SST anomalies over both regions work destructively for the long decaying cases. However, we could not quantitatively separate the roles of SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. Thus, the present results indicate that the different configurations of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific and in the Indian Ocean lead to different circulation anomalies over the WNP. Impacts of the Transition of El Niño Decaying Phases The negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific in JJA(1) for the short decaying cases are more likely to be the growing phase of La Niña events. To illustrate the effects of El Niño transition, the 84 short decaying El Niño events are further divided into two categories: 45 El Niño cases followed by La Niña events in D(1)JF(2) by the criterion of the D(1)JF(2) Niño 3 index being less than −1.0 standard deviation; and other 39 El Niño cases not followed by La Niña events. The seasonal evolution of these two kinds of short decaying El Niño events is shown in . The strength in the mature winter is slightly stronger for the El Niño with La Niña cases than that for the El Niño without La Niña cases, and they both decline in JJA(1). After JJA(1), they both have negative SST anomalies, but these signals are much weaker and recover to normal in the following year for the cases without La Niña. For the cases with La Niña, the decaying phase of El Niño is just the growing phase of the next La Niña event. The role of El Niño transition is indicated by the stronger WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1) for the El Niño followed by La Niña cases in . The El Niño decaying summer behaves as the La Niña growing summer, which is associated with the development of the WNPAC anomalies. As a result, the phase transition of El Niño decaying to La Niña developing leads to strong impacts of ENSO on the WNP summer anomalies. For the El Niño without La Niña type, the WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1) are much weaker. Thus, the persistence of the WNPAC anomalies related to the short decaying cases in JJA(1) shown in is mainly contributed to by the El Niño cases followed by La Niña, in comparison with those not followed by La Niña. shows the SST anomalies associated with these two categories of El Niño events. In D(0)JF(1), the SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean are stronger for the El Niño with La Niña cases (value of 0.46) than those for the El Niño without La Niña cases (value of 0.37). This further indicates that the positive Indian Ocean SST anomalies in the mature winter not only lead to the short decaying phase of El Niño, but also favor the phase transition of El Niño decaying to La Niña developing, which is consistent with . Thus, the intensity of SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean can be treated as a precursor to the transition of the El Niño decaying phase, and therefore the strength of the WNPAC anomalies. In JJA(1), the Indian Ocean SST anomalies are similar between the two categories, but the negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific are stronger for the El Niño with La Niña cases ( and ). This implies that the strong negative SST anomalies in this region might also contribute to the enhancement of the WNPAC anomalies associated with the short El Niño decaying cases followed by La Niña events. The negative SST anomalies shown in and are more like the La Niña conditions. However, indicated that there is no close relationship between the WNP circulation anomalies and La Niña events. To illustrate this difference, the circulation and SST anomalies associated with the La Niña cases (selected according to the DJF Niño 3 index) are further analyzed (figures not shown). We found that both for the observed and model results, a WNP anticyclonic anomaly is significant in the La Niña developing summer, but is very weak in the decaying summer. There are negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific and positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean during the La Niña developing summer, while there are negative SSTs in both regions during the decaying summer. These results further indicate that the SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, as well as those in the Indian Ocean, both affect the WNP circulation anomalies. The difference with might ‐ results from difference in analyzing periods. Our work focused on summer associated with ENSO cycles, while focused on the whole La Niña periods. Roles of the Intensity of El Niño in the Relationship Between El Niño and WNP Summer Climate In this Section, we investigate the roles of the intensity of El Niño events in D(0)JF(1) in influencing the WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1), by comparing the impacts of strong and moderate El Niño events. The strong (moderate) El Niño events are defined by the wintertime Niño 3 index anomaly being greater than 1.4 (greater than 1.0 but less than 1.4) standard deviation. Since a strong El Niño usually accompanies a the short decaying phase in this model [ ], we attempt to exclude the effects of the El Niño decaying phase in order to focus on the impacts of El Niño strength. For this purpose, the Niño 3 index anomalies in the decaying summer JJA(1) are limited to be within 0.7 standard deviations (higher than −0.7 standard deviations and lower than 0.7 standard deviations) among the 152 El Niño cases. Actually, the approach of fixing the intensity of the JJA(1) Niño 3 index within a small range is quite similar to fixing the decaying time of El Niño within a small range of time around JJA(1). Thus, this criterion filters out the El Niño cases with very long or very short decaying phases. Under these criteria, 32 strong and 37 moderate El Niño cases are chosen. The main conclusions drawn in this Section do not change by using the thresholds of 0.3 or 0.5 instead of 0.7 standard deviations. The seasonal evolution of strong and moderate El Niño is shown in . The development and decaying phases of the two categories of El Niño are similar. This means that the criterion we used here to distinguish the strong events with moderate ones, and meanwhile to remove the impacts of the decaying phase, is efficient. The intensity of the Niño 3 index for the strong events in the mature winter D(0)JF(1) increases by about 67% compared with the moderate ones (from 1.2 to 2.0°C). The standard deviations among the 32 strong events and 37 moderate ones are 0.55 and 0.13°C, respectively. This indicates that in comparison with the spread of the El Niño strength in each category, the difference between the two categories is remarkable. shows the 850‐hPa stream function anomalies related to the strong and moderate El Niño events. In comparison with the moderate cases, the strength of WNPAC anomalies for the strong events is roughly twice that of the moderate cases in both D(0)JF(1) and MAM(1), consistent with the change in the Niño 3 index. During JJA(1), the strength of WNPAC anomalies is also stronger for the strong events than that for the moderate ones, even though the significant center of the circulation anomalies shifts eastward to the east of the dateline for both the categories of El Niño events. Thus, the El Niño intensity plays a role in affecting the WNPAC anomalies, with the strong wintertime El Niño inducing the strong WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer. The spatial distributions of composite seasonal evolution of SST anomalies related to strong and moderate El Niño are similar, but their intensity is much stronger for strong cases ( ). Particularly in JJA(1), the SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific decline to slightly positive ones in the central Pacific and negative ones in the eastern Pacific, and the positive SST anomalies are maintained in the Indian Ocean. Since the SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific are both very weak for the strong and moderate cases, the stronger positive Indian Ocean SST anomalies for the strong El Niño events contribute to the enhancement of the WNPAC anomalies shown in , which is consistent with previous studies [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. To assess the relative roles of decaying phases and wintertime intensity of El Niño events, we further compare the categories of strong and moderate cases followed by short and long decaying phases respectively and the categories of short and long decaying cases accompanied by strong and moderate intensity respectively (figures not shown). The results indicate that the differences between the strong and moderate cases (no matter if followed by short or long decaying phases) are weaker than those between the short and long decaying cases (no matter if accompanied by strong or moderate intensity). This suggests that the duration of El Niño decaying phases has remarkable impacts on the WNPAC anomalies and the wintertime intensity of El Niño plays a secondary role. The present results emphasize that the El Niño decaying phase plays an important role in the persistence of WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer in addition to the wintertime El Niño strength. The results given by that the strong El Niño events are in favor of strong WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer, is essentially due to the fact that strong El Niño events tend to be followed by short decaying phases and transformation to La Niña events. Therefore, in their study, the effects of decaying phases and the intensity of El Niño are mingled. The present results indicate that it is necessary to separate the roles of the El Niño decaying phase and the wintertime intensity in order to better understand better the mechanisms responsible for the impacts of decaying El Niño events on the WNPAC anomalies. Observed Evidence About the Impacts of El Niño Decaying Phases The strong influence of El Niño decaying phases on the WNPAC anomalies was also investigated in observational data. The 11 El Niño events in are divided into five short decaying and six long decaying cases, according to the strength of the Niño 3 index in JJA(1) being less or greater than 0°C. The years 1951/52, 1965/66, 1972/73, 1994/95 and 1997/98 are defined as the short decaying El Niño events, and the years 1957/58, 1976/77, 1982/83, 1986/87, 1991/92 and 2002/03 are the long decaying cases. It should be noted that the case of 1986/87 is a special one in that it has the mature phase in summer, rather than winter, so we exclude it from the long decaying cases in the following. The composite seasonal evolution of the two classes of El Niño events is shown in . Both the short and long decaying cases share the similar developing phases and intensities in the mature winter, but the decaying durations are different. The averaged Niño 3 index in JJA(1) is −0.39°C for the short decaying events, much lower than that for the long decaying ones (0.42°C). shows the impacts of the different El Niño decaying phases on the WNPAC anomalies in observations. The WNPAC anomalies are strong in D(0)JF(1) and decline rapidly in MAM(1) for both the short and long decaying El Niño cases. However, for the short decaying cases, the WNPAC anomalies are reinforced again during the decaying summer ( ), which are in contrast with the insignificant circulation anomalies over the WNP for the long decaying events in JJA(1) ( ). These pronounced differences of the WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1) associated with different categories of El Niño events indicate a stronger relationship between the short decaying El Niño and the WNP summer anomalies, which are consistent with the model results ( ). In addition, a pair of cyclonic circulation anomalies located in the eastern Pacific corresponds to the evolution of El Niño events. The strength of the pair of cyclonic circulation anomalies is stronger in D(0)JF(1) and MAM(1) for the long decaying events than those for the short decaying ones. The stronger westerly anomalies induced by the pair of cyclone anomalies favor the positive SST anomalies maintaining in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, which lead to a long decaying phase of El Niño. The features of the pair of cyclone anomalies in the eastern Pacific are also consistent with the model results ( ). For the short decaying El Niño events, the WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1) are stronger than those in MAM(1) ( and ), which is inconsistent with the model results ( and ). This might be due to some uncertainties in the composite results induced by a small number of events in observations. There are great differences in stream function and SST anomalies among the five short decaying cases. Some descriptions about the circulation and SST anomalies for these cases are given below, without figures being shown. The weakness of composite WNPAC anomalies in MAM(1) relative to those in JJA(1) is mainly caused by the 1965/66 and 1994/95 cases. In these two cases, over the WNP, there are cyclonic anomalies in MAM(1), associated with positive SST anomalies in the central tropical Pacific, and anticyclonic anomalies in JJA(1), without significant SST anomalies in the central tropical Pacific. Similarly, the uncertainty of the composite observed results induced by the small number of samples in observations prompts the differences between the model and observational results ( and ). Among the five short decaying cases in observations, for three cases (1951/52, 1965/66 and 1972/73) there are WNPAC anomalies extending from the WNP to the central and eastern Pacific, while for the other two cases (1994/95 and 1997/98), the WNPAC anomalies are limited to the west of the dateline and cyclonic anomalies are located in the eastern Pacific (figures not shown). The WNPAC anomalies associated with the short decaying cases in the model ( ) resemble well the observed ones for the former three cases, and show a discrepancy with the latter two cases over the eastern Pacific. Thus, the differences in the circulation anomalies between (model) and (observations) might not be necessary to indicate that the model fails in capturing the ENSO‐related circulation anomalies over the eastern Pacific. The structures of circulation anomalies associated with the short and long decaying El Niño events are shown by the 850‐hPa wind anomalies in , which further illustrates that the short decaying cases are related to the stronger WNPAC anomalies in JJA(1). For the long decaying cases, the westerly anomalies in the northeastern subtropical Pacific are associated with the wind anomalies in the higher latitudes instead of those in the tropical region during MAM(1) and JJA(1). From the details of circulation anomalies associated with El Niño shown by the 850‐hPa wind anomalies in , we further conclude that the short decaying phases of El Niño are important to the WNPAC anomalies. In observations, we do not divide the short decaying El Niño into ‘followed by’ or ‘not followed by’ La Niña types, because of the small number of samples. The anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the WNP shown as are very similar with a typical anomalous wind pattern associated with the growing phase of La Niña. This implies a role of El Niño transition in the WNPAC anomalies for the short decaying cases in observations, being consistent with the model results. The SST anomalies associated with the different El Niño decaying phases in observations are illustrated in . In D(0)JF(1), the positive SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean are stronger for the short decaying cases than those for the long decaying cases, especially in the western Indian Ocean. These Indian Ocean SST anomalies contribute to the transition of an El Niño decaying phase to a La Niña developing phase [ ], and the phase transition is in favor of the enhancement of WNPAC anomalies in the El Niño decaying summer ( ), which supports the model results. In JJA(1), the composite SST anomalies in observations bear some similarities to those in the model results, especially for the long decaying cases. However, the magnitudes of SST anomalies in both the Indian Ocean and tropical Pacific are weak for the short decaying cases, while they are slightly stronger for the long decaying cases in observations in comparison with the model results ( ). It is worth pointing out that there are some uncertainties in the observational composites due to a small number of samples and therefore it is difficult to disentangle whether these differences between observational and model results reflect a model deficiency or uncertainty due to an insufficient number of samples in observations. For the long decaying cases, the roles of the positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and in the central and eastern tropical Pacific work destructively and induce weak WNP circulation anomalies, which are similar to those discussed in the model simulation ( ). Discussion and Conclusions The influence of El Niño behavior on the relationship between El Niño and the WNP summer climate has been investigated by using a 1000‐year pre‐industrial simulation. The relationship is characterized as the strength of the WNPAC anomalies in the El Niño decaying summer. The roles of El Niño decaying phase and the El Niño intensity in inducing the WNPAC anomalies have been illustrated respectively. The results suggest that the transition of decaying phases is another important factor influencing the WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer in addition to El Niño intensity. The short decaying phases lead to an enhancement of the WNPAC anomalies, and among these short decaying events, the strong WNPAC anomalies are contributed to mainly by those El Niño cases that are followed by La Niña. On the contrary, the long decaying phases are related to the weak WNP circulation anomalies in the El Niño decaying summer. These model results are basically supported by observed evidence, although the number of El Niño cases is limited in observations. The present results suggest that the strength of SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean in the mature winter D(0)JF(1) might play an important role in leading to different lengths of El Niño decaying phases. The D(0)JF(1) SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean are significantly positive (regional averaged value of 0.42°C) for the short decaying cases, but they are insignificant and very weak (0.22°C), although positive, for the long decaying cases. On the other hand, the D(0)JF(1) SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific are similar between the short and long decaying cases. The wintertime positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean generate the easterly anomaly extending to the western and central equatorial Pacific in the subsequent spring and summer, which leads to a decline of positive SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific and results in a short decaying of El Niño. Therefore, the strength of the positive D(0)JF(1) SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean tends to be a precursor to the different decaying phases of El Niño. During the El Niño decaying summer JJA(1), the configurations of SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and in the central and eastern tropical Pacific lead to the difference in the strength of the WNPAC anomalies. For the short decaying cases, both positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean and the negative SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific work constructively and contribute to the persistence of significant WNPAC anomalies. For the long decaying phase, though the WNPAC anomalies can be induced by the positive SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean, they are offset by the role of positive SST anomalies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, leading to weak circulation anomalies over the WNP. The impacts of El Niño intensity on the WNPAC anomalies in the El Niño decaying summer have also been illustrated in our study. The El Niño intensity also plays a role in the WNPAC anomalies during the decaying summer. Considering strong El Niño events are often followed by a short decaying phase, we defined the strong and moderate events both decline in the summer JJA(1), in order to distinguish the impacts of El Niño intensity and decaying phase. Both the strong and moderate El Niño events induce the WNPAC anomalies in the decaying summer, but the strength of the WNPAC anomalies are stronger for the strong events, which is consistent with previous studies. The model and observed results indicate that the transition of El Niño decaying phases is important for the impacts of El Niño on the WNP summer anomalies. Thus, attention should be paid not only to the strength of El Niño but also to the El Niño decaying phases for the prediction of the WNP summer climate.

The processes governing variability within the Philippine seas occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales. On the large scale, there is exchange of mass and properties between the internal Philippine seas and the bounding western Pacific Ocean and South China Sea (SCS). This exchange may be modulated over various time scales, for example by episodic remote forcing of large‐scale planetary Rossby waves from the western Pacific Ocean that can penetrate into the internal seas [ ; ], or by regional forcing on intraseasonal, seasonal and interannual time scales related to the monsoonal reversing winds [ ] and ENSO. Monsoon surge events cause intensified wind jets through the gaps along the mountainous topography of many Philippine islands, creating strong wind curl patterns in their lee that induce oceanic eddy shedding [ , ; ]. On smaller space and shorter time scales, the narrow straits and the abrupt changes in bathymetry within and between the Philippine basins can often result in swift tidal currents [ ; ; ]. Hydraulically controlled benthic overflows can cause turbulence that leads to elevated mixing [ ], with important consequences to the ventilation of the many deep basins within the Philippine archipelago, impacting their geochemistry and regional primary productivity [ ; ]. Flow through Luzon Strait (sill depth 2200 m), between Taiwan and Luzon island in the northern Philippines, enters the SCS from the western Pacific Ocean. The SCS is connected to the deep Sulu Sea basin (∼5000 m), west of the main Philippine archipelago, through the Mindoro Strait (∼500 m) – Panay Strait (∼580 m) complex to the east of the Palawan island chain ( ). Mindoro Strait is the only pathway for the SCS throughflow at thermocline and sub‐thermocline depth, and is thought to play a critical role in regulating the heat and freshwater balance of the SCS throughflow system [ ; ]. The relatively narrower Balabac Strait (∼10–30 m) to the west of Palawan and the wider shelf of the southwest SCS that leads to the Karimata Strait provide shallower pathways for the SCS throughflow. Waters from the western Pacific Ocean can also flow directly into the Philippine archipelago via the San Bernardino (80 m) and Surigao (∼60 m) Straits ( ). West of San Bernardino, waters in the Sibuyan Sea are connected to the SCS via Verde Island Passage (<100 m), and to the Sulu Sea via the Tablas Strait (∼560 m) that is separated from the Mindoro‐Panay Strait complex by a small basin (∼1300 m) known as the Semirara Sea ( ). West of Surigao, waters in the Bohol Sea are directly connected to the Sulu Sea via the Dipolog Strait (∼450 m). The southern boundary of the Sulu Sea is open to the Sulawesi Sea through the Sibutu Passage (∼270 m), where water can either return to the western Pacific Ocean or contribute to the Indonesian Throughflow [ ]. Many details of the local dynamics and circulation in the straits of the Philippine seas are still not well understood. To date, most of our knowledge of the generation, evolution and fate of the properties and flow structures within the Philippine seas has come principally from models, which have been poorly constrained by the few observational data in the region. Until recently there existed only a few discrete hydrographic surveys [e.g., ] and ship drift records [ ] that documented the circulation and properties within the region. described the surface circulation in the Sulu Sea as reversing in response to the monsoon winds. The ship‐drift data suggested that during the peak of the Northeast Monsoon (NEM: December–March), Pacific Ocean surface waters enter westward through the Surigao and San Bernardino Straits into the Sulu Sea, and exit northward through Mindoro into the SCS and southward through Sibutu Passage into the Sulawesi Sea [ ]. During the Southwest Monsoon (SWM: June–September) the surface flow is southward from the SCS in Mindoro Strait, and circulation within the Sulu Sea is cyclonic [ ]. Recent high‐resolution modeling studies [ ] and remotely sensed data [ ] confirmed the reversing surface circulation in the Sulu Sea is mainly driven by local monsoon wind, although remote forcing can significantly modify the surface circulation and becomes more important just before the monsoon peaks. At intermediate depths, one‐time hydrographic CTD surveys suggest that Subtropical Lower Water, characterized by a salinity maximum at ∼200 m depth, spreads from the SCS into the Sulu Sea via Mindoro Strait [ ; ]. However, only the upper portion of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), found at depths of 400–800 m in the SCS, is able to pass over the 450 m sill at Mindoro Strait into the Sulu Sea. NPIW is characterized by salinity and oxygen minima [ ]. Recent evidence shows overflow of NPIW at Panay Strait is hydraulically controlled [ ], and is the primary source for the intermediate waters of the Sulu Sea [ ; ; ]. Most of the reported transport estimates in the straits of the Philippine archipelago have been based on model output. In Mindoro Strait, the models mostly estimate a mean southward transport ranging from ∼0.5 Sv to 4 Sv [ ; ; , ; ; ], with a similar range of model transport estimates reported for the outflow at the Sibutu Passage. estimate 2.4 Sv southward transport in Mindoro Strait through application of hydraulic control theory to remotely sensed altimetric and ocean bottom pressure measurements, and a 2.8 Sv Sibutu Passage outflow, suggesting a small contribution to the Sulu Sea probably enters via Dipolog Strait. Here we describe the property, velocity and transport estimates from the first moored time series measurements in Mindoro, Tablas, and Panay Straits that connect the SCS to the Sulu Sea in the Philippine archipelago ( ). Mooring measurements were made as part of the Office of Naval Research “Characterization and Modeling of Archipelago Strait Dynamics,” commonly referred to as the Philippine Straits Dynamics Experiment (PhilEx) [ ]. Along with the mooring time series, the fieldwork component of PhilEx consisted of numerous CTD and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (L‐ADCP) measurements, glider and drifter surveys, and a high‐frequency (HF) radar system installed on the island of Panay ( ). Results from both the hydrographic fieldwork and modeling analyses are discussed in a special volume [see ]. As part of this special volume, some of the moored velocity time series at discrete depths are presented and discussed in , in relation to a wind‐driven reversal during February 2008 in , and compared to HYCOM model output in . The deep overflow observed in Panay Strait is the subject of . In this paper, our focus is the variation of the flow structure and property profiles in Mindoro, Tablas and Panay Straits. We also derive the mean and variability of the transport estimates in the straits, and discuss how they relate to the large‐scale monsoonal forcing. The paper is organized as follows. In we detail the deployments and instrumentation of the PhilEx moorings. describes the vertical structure of the velocity and property variability, and the subsequent supply of different water masses into and out of the Sulu Sea. In , we first discuss the inherent assumptions behind the transport calculation for each strait, and then present the seasonal variations and means of the transport estimates. A discussion of possible forcing mechanisms is given in , followed by conclusions in . The PhilEx Mooring Measurements The location, deployment depth, and deployment periods for the PhilEx moorings are given in . All moorings were deployed within 1–2 km of the sill in each strait as surveyed by the shipboard multibeam echo sounder. Mooring velocity instrumentation configuration was similar on all moorings (see ), with ADCPs deployed to resolve the vertical profile of the flow. The ADCPs included pressure and temperature sensors, and if there was additional mooring line available, discrete temperature‐pressure and/or temperature‐salinity‐pressure sensors were also deployed ( ). Sampling rates were set to resolve the tides, and were 30 min for the ADCPs and 15 min for the temperature and salinity sensors. The first PhilEx mooring in Panay Strait was deployed as part of the Exploratory Cruise on the R / V Melville in June 2007. This mooring was recovered and redeployed after 3 weeks to provide contextual data for the hydrographic measurements made as part of this cruise. Additional moorings were deployed in Mindoro Strait and in Tablas Strait during a December 2007 cruise, when the Panay mooring was recovered, refurbished and then redeployed. All moorings were recovered in March 2009. The majority of the ADCP instrumentation successfully returned 100% of the 15–18 month velocity time series record. However, as with many moorings that are deployed within the dynamic environment of narrow straits with swift tidal currents, the PhilEx moorings experienced some data loss through mooring and instrumental failure. Unfortunately, in Tablas Strait the ADCP designed to capture the bottom flows flooded at some stage during the deployment period, and efforts by a commercial data recovery service were unable to extract any information from the ADCP data card. In addition, due to surface reflection contamination, the ADCPs are often unable to sample the near‐surface layer ( ). For Mindoro and Tablas Straits, where the ADCPs were mounted on the moorings at 150‐m and 200‐m depth respectively ( ), typically only the upper 20 m velocities are missing. In Panay Strait, where the ADCP was bottom‐mounted, the upper 40 m of the water column is missing. In , we will discuss how these data gaps are handled for the transport calculations that require full‐depth velocity measurements. Pressure time series from the ADCPs and some available discrete CTD sensors were used to account for mooring blowover through tidal and low frequency forcing, although corrections to depth from mooring blowover was typically <20 m. The velocity data were then vertically linearly interpolated onto a 10‐m depth grid and a common time base of 1 h. The resulting velocity time series were low‐pass filtered with a 4‐day Hamming window to suppress the inertial and tidal variability, and then subsampled to daily values. Finally, the Cartesian velocities in each strait were rotated into along‐strait velocities (ASV) based on the orientation of the strait and the subsequent major axis of the strongest flow (typically near‐bottom): Mindoro Strait 355°T (true); Tablas Strait 10°T; Panay Strait 320°T. The sign convention for ASV and transport to be used in this paper is negative (positive) toward (away from) the Sulu Sea. In most cases the cross‐strait velocities (XSV) are near‐zero. However, because the rotation is based mainly on the bottom flows in narrow sill channels, XSV can at times be significant in the upper layer where the channel is wider, and also where side channels may feed cross flow into the strait. Instances where XSV may contribute to the throughflow are discussed in the text. Velocity and Property Variability While the primary focus of this analysis is on the distribution and variability of transport with depth in the passages leading into the Sulu Sea, it is instructive to first examine the vertical profile of ASV from the ADCP mooring data. It is the vertical distribution of the flow through each strait that, to a large extent, will set the heat flux of the flow into the Sulu Sea. Unfortunately, due to the substantial fishing and shipping pressures in these narrow passages, none of the moorings completely measured the full depth property variability, so we are unable to estimate the property transports from the available data. Nonetheless, all moorings measured bottom temperature where strong, deep overflows occur. In addition, the CTD sensors at intermediate depths on the Mindoro and Tablas moorings ( ) enable us to examine the spreading of water masses from the SCS into the internal seas of the archipelago, and their relationship with the flow variability. For the interested reader, time series of the flow in each passage at depths of 150 m, 300 m and the near bottom are found in , and the full depth velocity time series of Mindoro Strait is given in , and of Panay Strait in . Mean Along‐Strait Velocity shows the mean, standard deviation, and range of ASV during the NEM and SWM for the depths resolved by the ADCP measurements in each passage for calendar year 2008, the common deployment period for each mooring ( ). In 2008, northward flow in the upper layer of Mindoro Strait begins in the boreal spring transition in April and continues through the SWM until the end of the fall transition in November (see Figure 4 of ). During the NEM, the ASV is primarily southward with strong speeds of up to ∼0.9 m s −1 possible at 100–130 m depth ( ), although there are episodic bursts of weak or northward flow every 20 days or so [ ]. Subsequently, the mean annual flow in the upper layer of Mindoro Strait is slightly northward at 0.1 m s −1 and the variability in this layer is strong ( ). Note that the near surface flow in Mindoro Strait during 2008 is of the opposite sense to that suggested by , based on the expected Ekman response to the monsoonal reversals. Possible reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed below in . At intermediate depths, the mean ASV in Mindoro Strait is slightly southward and the variability relatively low ( ). The southward ASV strengthens in the benthic layer, with mean speeds of ∼−0.3 m s −1 and maximum speeds of >0.7 m s −1 are possible during both the NEM and SWM ( ). While the mean XSV in Mindoro Strait is mostly negligible, in the upper layer above ∼80 m there is a mean ∼0.2 m s −1 westward flow (not shown). This relatively shallow westward XSV likely derives from Tablas Strait in response to the strong episodic northerly wind surges during the NEM [ ]. Similar to Mindoro Strait, the ASV in the upper layer of Panay Strait is ∼0.2 ms −1 northward in the mean ( ). The missing ASV in the upper 40 m at this mooring site makes the connection of the near‐surface flow to the monsoon variability more problematic. At intermediate depths the mean flow is slightly southward but maximum speeds of >0.6 m s −1 are observed, particularly during the fall transition and NEM ( ). In Panay Strait, the strong benthic overflow can reach speeds >1 m s −1 in either monsoon phase, with a mean of −0.7 m s −1 toward the Sulu Sea occurring at 520‐m depth, which is 40–50 m above the bottom. The variability in the benthic layer ASV is low, and below 490 m the flow is always toward the Sulu Sea ( ). Note that the mean flow recorded in the benthic layer at the Panay Strait mooring site is stronger than that found in the (shallower) benthic layer at the Mindoro Strait mooring site. Since Mindoro Strait is the main portal for flow from the SCS into Panay Strait, this possibly implies that 1) the Mindoro mooring site may not have been optimally located to capture the strongest benthic flow through this channel; 2) the channel geometry is wider in Mindoro Strait at depth so that it can carry more flow/transport, and/or 3) there may be a significant contribution from the (not measured) benthic flow through Tablas Strait ( ) into Panay Strait. These issues will be addressed when calculations of the transports in each strait are made in . The mean XSV was relatively large in the Panay Strait benthic layer, although still significantly smaller that the ASV. This is likely due to the deepening of the channel's southern bank or tidal friction [ ]. The mean ASV measured in the upper and intermediate depths in Tablas Strait is very weak ( ). The mean ASV alternates from slightly northward in the upper layer, southward from 140–200 m depth, near‐zero at 200–270 m, then slightly southward below this to the deepest level of our ADCP mooring observations at 360 m (recall that the up‐ward looking, bottom‐mounted ADCP in Tablas Strait failed). While in the upper layer current speeds of equal strength can occur during either monsoon phase, at intermediate depth both northward and southward currents are stronger during the NEM compared to the SWM ( ). Property Variability Subtropical Lower Water (also known as North Pacific Subtropical Water [ ; ]), characterized by a salinity maximum near ∼200 m, enters the SCS via the Luzon Strait from the Philippine Sea in the Western Pacific [ ; ]. Since the salinity maximum layer lies well above the sill depths in Mindoro and Panay Straits, this water mass is also present within the Sulu Sea basin [ ; ; ]. Two CTD sensors on the mooring in Mindoro Strait – one at a mean depth level of 206 m and another at 312 m – capture the seasonal variability in the potential temperature ( θ ) and salinity (S) properties of the Subtropical Lower Water ( ). Although most Sulu Sea hydrographic surveys suggest the salinity maximum occurs at ∼200 m, a depth similar to where it is found in the SCS [ ], the Mindoro Strait time series shows the water column is slightly saltier at ∼300 m compared to ∼200 m ( ). At 206 m, the Mindoro Strait θ ‐S properties are saltier and warmer when flow is toward the Sulu Sea ( ) primarily during the NEM and in the fall transition ( ). During the spring transition and SWM, the properties at 206 m in Mindoro Strait are fresher and cooler ( ) when flow is weak or northward ( ). Although there is little correspondence of temperature and salinity with flow strength and direction at 244 m depth in Tablas Strait ( ), a similar salinity range is found to that at 206 m in Mindoro Strait during the spring transition and SWM ( ). found interleaving of the Subtropical Lower Water salinity maximum water with the shallower salinity minimum waters within the Semirara Sea that separates the two straits ( ) occurs during the spring and weakens as the SWM evolves. This suggests that the Semirara Sea is the likely source of the fresher waters in both Mindoro and Tablas Straits during these seasons ( ). In contrast, the θ ‐S properties at 312 m depth in Mindoro and 345 m depth in Tablas Strait show little seasonal influence ( ). There is a suggestion of slightly saltier properties at both Mindoro and Tablas with flow away from the Sulu Sea at these depths ( ). In Tablas Strait, the mean salinity is ∼34.51 psu at both 244 m and 345 m depth, slightly less than the salinity maxima measured in Mindoro Strait at 207 m (∼34.53) and 312 m (34.57) which has a more direct connection to the SCS. This is consistent with who found a climatological mean salinity of ∼34.54 in the salinity maximum layer of the southern SCS near Mindoro Strait. The lower salinity in Tablas Strait may also be a consequence of mixing with lower salinity water masses from within the Sibuyan Sea [ ]. The ventilation of the Sulu Sea is known to occur through strong benthic currents that spill over the sills in the Mindoro‐Panay Strait complex [ ; ]. As noted above, the primary source water is NPIW, which is characterized by a low salinity and low oxygen core, found at depth levels of approximately 400–500 m in the SCS [ ; ]. Hydrographic surveys suggest a θ of ∼9.8°C in Mindoro Strait that is much warmer than waters at this same depth level in the SCS [ ; ; ], and so results in unique geochemical properties with implications for carbon uptake within the deep Sulu Sea [ ]. The mean θ measured just ∼10 m above the sill depth is 9.79°C in Mindoro Strait (at 450 m) and 9.81°C in Panay Strait (560 m) in excellent agreement with the hydrographic surveys. However, the benthic temperature shows substantial variability over the mooring deployment period ( ). The range of 8.72°–10.94°C and standard deviation σ = 0.42°C of bottom θ at Mindoro Strait is much larger compared to Panay Strait with a range of 9.52–10.08°C and σ = 0.11°C, and Tablas Strait with a range of 10.05°–10.6°C and σ = 0.11°C. Thus, even though the sill depth at Mindoro is ∼100 m less than either Panay or Tablas sill depths, the bottom temperature at Mindoro is much cooler when there is stronger southward flow from the SCS. Conversely, during periods of weak or northward flow within Mindoro Strait, temperatures are warmer and similar to those found in Panay and Tablas. This tendency may reflect the higher levels of entrainment and mixing occurring downstream of the sills [ ; ] that results in higher temperatures and salinities than found on corresponding depth layers within the SCS. Although we lack concurrent ASV information on the sill in Tablas Strait, shows the deep Sibuyan Sea has a similar potential temperature of 10.4°C to the Tablas Strait mean of 10.3°C, suggesting that there could also be significant exchange between this sea and the deep waters observed in Tablas Strait. Transport Variability Our primary goal is to provide a meaningful estimate of the mass flux through each of the instrumented straits that connect the Sulu Sea to the SCS and so provide the first observed time series of the magnitude and exchange of the transport. Unfortunately, single‐point mooring measurements such as made during PhilEx, can compromise the integration of the depth and across‐passage interpolation of the along‐channel flow needed to compute accurate transport estimates (i.e. ∬ ASVdxdz ). The mooring point velocity observations need to be (1) laterally extrapolated across the passage to the strait sidewalls, and (2) vertically extrapolated where there may be gaps with depth. In this section, before describing the transport variability with depth through each passage, we first discuss how we will handle the missing flows in the surface and bottom layers, as well as the cross‐sectional velocity structure. Choices for the extrapolation schemes will be guided by the available shipboard ADCP and L‐ADCP velocity sections made in each passage, the HF Radar data, and model output. Nonetheless, there are errors associated with each scheme and these will be discussed and detailed with respect to their impact on the transport estimate. Assumptions for Transport Calculations Because of surface reflection contamination, upward‐looking ADCPs are unable to resolve the very near surface velocity. During Philex, the ADCPs in Tablas Strait and Mindoro Strait that measured the upper layer flow were located at mid‐water column depths ( ), and hence only the velocity in the upper 20 m was missed. In these two straits, the surface gaps were filled assuming a constant velocity equal to the shallowest measured velocity (i.e., a “slab” extrapolation). The bottom‐mounted configuration of the ADCP in Panay Strait ( ) missed the upper 40 m of the near‐surface layer. In Panay Strait, some information of the near surface circulation is available from the HF Radar measurements. The HF Radar data provides concurrent velocity measurements over the period 30 July 2008 to the recovery of the Panay mooring on 16 March 2009 ( ). The agreement between the surface ASV from the radar (ASV z=0 ) and the resolved mooring measurement at 50 m (ASV z=50 ) is quite good (r = 0.62). A least squares fit of the data gives ASV z=0 = 0.06 + 0.63ASV z=50 . This least squares fit will be used to fill in the missing surface values in Panay Strait, and we then assume a linear fit for the missing mooring ASV at depths between the surface and 50 m. The missing velocity at the ocean bottom also needs to be accounted for in the transport calculations. In Mindoro and Panay Straits, only the bottom 20 m is missing. Two extrapolation schemes were considered. Given the strong benthic flows observed on the sills at these mooring sites, the first scheme assumed a slab model and assigned the deepest measured velocity to the missing data below, assuming zero velocity at the bottom. A second scheme applied a constant shear from the deepest measured velocity to zero velocity at the bottom. Bottom measurements from discrete L‐ADCP casts in the direct vicinity of the sill at Mindoro ( ) and Panay ( ) Straits show casts where both schemes might be representative of the true bottom flow. In Tablas Strait, because of the failure of the near‐bottom ADCP ( ), filling the missing lower 200 m of the water column is more problematic. A one‐time shipboard ADCP survey just north of the sill in Tablas Strait during December 2007 ( ) suggests a relatively quiescent benthic flow in this passage. Similarly, the 1/12° global HYCOM model shows relatively weak (<0.05 m s −1 ) flow in the lower layer directed toward the Sulu Sea in the annual mean [ ]. Both a slab layer and a constant shear model were used to extrapolate the missing bottom velocities for the transport calculations in Tablas Strait. Errors in the transport estimates of the lower layer in Tablas Strait can also be assessed in light of any differences between the deep Mindoro and Panay transports: given the geometry of the straits ( ), it is reasonable to assume to first order through conservation requirements, that any bottom flow through Panay Strait not supplied by Mindoro Strait possibly should have been supplied by Tablas Strait. Of course, residency time or storage within the Semirara Sea is not accounted for in this simple scenario. Perhaps the largest contributor to the errors in the transport calculations is the extrapolation of the ASV measured at the single mooring site in each passage to the strait sidewalls. The cross‐passage shipboard transect velocity measurements offer some guidance for the extrapolations ( ). In each case, the ADCP transects were generally conducted between each of the channel sidewalls and orthogonal to the along‐channel flow. However, whereas the moored velocity measurements are continuous over ∼15–18 months, the ADCP transects are mostly discrete short period surveys albeit over different phases of the tidal and monsoon cycle. In Mindoro ( ) and Panay ( ) the shipboard surveys were 24‐h repeat transects and so the averaging removes some of the higher frequency tidal signals. In Tablas Strait ( ) however, only single one‐time ADCP transects are available. Changes in the cross‐channel flow structure can occur over relatively short time periods, although in general changes in the vertical structure of the ADCP velocity agreed well with the concurrent subinertial ASV profile measured at the mooring site over the same time period ( ). Thus with these caveats in mind, in the following we use the ADCP velocity transects that to date provide our best and only option to explore the observed cross‐sectional, along‐strait flow within each of the narrow channels needed for the transport integration. All the available ADCP and L‐ADCP surveys denote ASV variability occurs over different depth ranges at different times across each passage on either side of a mooring site ( and ). In Mindoro Strait, the L‐ADCP casts ( ) and repeat shipboard ADCP surveys ( and ) show a surface to intermediate depth layer that varies in cross‐passage structure from cruise to cruise, although the mean cross‐passage ASV profiles (thick blue lines in and ) fall within the range of ASV measured at the mooring site during the time of the ADCP surveys (red zone in and ). This suggests that, at least at the time of the surveys, the occasional opposing flows on either side of the mooring largely cancel out when considering the flow structure across the channel. In the benthic layer of Mindoro Strait, both the ADCP casts ( and ) and model results [ ] suggest enhanced southward flow probably occurs just west of the mooring location. This westward intensification is likely a result of the channel geometry that is northwestward upstream of the mooring site toward the deep inflow from the SCS ( ). Recall also that the mean deep ASV measured at Mindoro ( ) was substantially less than that measured at Panay ( ). Hence the benthic transport estimated from the ASV at the Mindoro mooring site will probably underestimate the total deep transport contribution through this passage. In Panay Strait, the June 2007 ADCP survey ( ) suggests enhanced upper layer flow occurs west of the mooring, and the yearlong average surface ASV measured by the HF radar across a zonal section at 11.26°N also shows slightly stronger flow occurs to the west of the mooring site ( ). However, the western intensification is not present during the February 2009 ( ) ADCP survey, and as in Mindoro Strait, the mean ADCP ASV profiles are mostly within the range of ASV measured contemporaneously at the mooring site, particularly those ADCP profiles in nearer proximity to the mooring ( and ). This suggests that the mooring in Panay Strait was favorably located to capture the deep overflow into the Sulu Sea. The two one‐time shipboard ADCP surveys in Tablas Strait also show the vertical structure of the cross‐channel averaged ADCP measurements has fairly good agreement with the concurrent ASV measurements at the Tablas mooring site ( ). The shipboard ADCP and L‐ADCP surveys suggest three possible schemes for the cross‐passage extrapolation (in 1‐km bins) of the mooring ASV data in each passage: (1) linear interpolation from the mooring across the passage (denoted linear in the following); (2) assign the measured ASV to the half‐width of each passage, centered about the mooring location (half‐width); and (3) extrapolate uniformly across the whole passage (full‐width). In all transport schemes, zero flow is assumed in the last kilometer bin nearest the sidewalls, suggesting an effective channel width that is slightly less than the topographic width (see ). This conforms to the shipboard ADCP measurements in each passage ( ) and the HF radar surface measurements in Panay Strait ( ) that show little sidewall boundary effects. Here we use the 30‐arc second bathymetry to determine the strait area between the 100 m isobaths on either side of each channel for the transport calculations, thus neglecting the shallow shelf regions to the west of Panay and Tablas Straits and either side of the Mindoro mooring site ( ). In the following, we show transports calculated using the surface extrapolations in each strait noted above, a slab layer for the missing bottom layers, and the full‐width extrapolation across the passage. These schemes are considered to give our best transport estimates. As noted, the errors are likely to be largest for our cross‐passage extrapolations, particularly in the surface layer transports where the passage is widest. Collectively the lateral schemes provide a range of possible transport values: the half‐width scheme will likely be a mid‐range estimate between the possible lower bound from the linear extrapolation and the upper bound from the full‐width extrapolation. The range of transports using each scheme will be reported as our uncertainty error. In addition, we will also address the impact on the transport estimates of the missing bottom measurements in Tablas Strait and the sub‐optimal location of the Mindoro mooring site slightly east of the likely benthic ASV maximum, and the implications of these for the observed deep overflow captured in Panay Strait. Vertical Distribution of Transport The upper layer transport in Mindoro Strait is dominated by an annual cycle, with strong northward transport from the surface to ∼170 m during the SWM of boreal summer, and strong southward transport appearing in two distinct pulses each of about 3 weeks duration during the two surveyed NEMs ( ). In contrast, the upper layer transport in Panay Strait has a more episodic nature throughout the entire deployment period ( ), although in general the transport is northward, stronger during the late NEM and with weak southward transport evident during the fall transition (September–October). Similarly, in Tablas Strait the upper transport time series shows no clear monsoonal relationship, and is characterized more by short‐period variability on time scales of 10–20 days ( ). The most striking feature of the Panay transport time series is the intermediate depth core of strong flow toward the Sulu Sea that begins during the fall transition (September–October) and lasts through to the end of the NEM ( ). Similar strong subsurface pulses occur in Mindoro Strait during the NEM that are separated from the upper layer southward pulses by a region of weaker transport ( ). Since the subsurface cores occur during both of the surveyed NEMs in Panay and Mindoro Straits, this suggests a monsoonal relationship, rather than an isolated event phenomenon. Initially during the fall transition, the top of the subsurface core in Panay Strait is found at ∼180 m depth and progressively shoals to ∼100 m depth by the end of the NEM. A similar shoaling is apparent in Mindoro Strait during the survey period, although the transport during the fall transition is not as strong and the strongest NEM cores are slightly higher up in the water column compared to those in Panay Strait. In Tablas Strait the intermediate depth transport is mostly toward the Sulu Sea nearly year‐round, with a hint of deeper reaching southward transport during the NEM ( ) corresponding to when the stronger intermediate depth southward transport occurs in Mindoro and Panay Strait ( and ). Although the strongest southward transport is associated with the intermediate depth cores in Mindoro and Panay Straits, below this the transport is largely toward the Sulu Sea ( and ). The bottom intensification of the transport in both straits is associated with the benthic overflows that act to ventilate the Sulu Sea to ∼1250 m depth [ ]. In Mindoro Strait, the benthic overflow results in a slight secondary transport maximum near bottom ( ). Whereas downstream in the deeper Panay Strait, the deep secondary transport maximum appears stronger at ∼520 m ( ), consistent with the mean ASV observations that show the southward ASV maximum occurs ∼50 m above the sill ( ). Isolated intermediate depth northward reversals in transport are evident in both Mindoro and Panay Straits during late February–early March 2008 and again in mid‐May 2008 ( and ). When these intermediate depth reversals occur, the southward transport in the benthic layer of each strait is considerably reduced. Weaker intermediate depth northward reversals are also observed in Tablas Strait during these same time periods ( ). Clearly in Mindoro and Panay Straits, the northward flow appears first at depth, and this is then followed by northward flow at shallower depths. This upward phase propagation is a characteristic signature of downwelling Kelvin waves [e.g., ]. The possible impact of these large‐scale planetary waves on the transport variability within the Philippine archipelago will be discussed further in . The mean transports in each 10‐m depth layer ( ) will help guide our choice of depth layers for examining the integrated transport time series and their relationship between the three straits. Ideally we would like to examine the vertical distribution of the transport in terms of density layers, as this classification would more clearly indicate the most plausible pathways for the circulation and more readily provide evidence of any vertical redistribution of the fluxes through mixing. Unfortunately full‐depth temperature and salinity profiles were not possible on the moorings in these narrow and dynamic passages. Nonetheless, the profiles of the mean transport with depth in each passage provide an informative first look at the vertical partitioning of transport between the three Philippine straits. Both Panay ( ) and Tablas Straits ( ) show a similar mean vertical structure with three‐cores, albeit of different magnitude. Northward transport occurs in the upper layer down to 130 m, with an intermediate depth core of southward transport and below that, a second core of southward transport that in Panay Strait is associated with the sill overflow. In contrast, the vertical structure in Mindoro Strait shows a distinct two‐layer structure with northward transport in the upper 230 m and southward transport below ( ). As in Panay Strait, the strongest core in Mindoro Strait is associated with the sill overflow. Simple conservation arguments would suggest that the northward transport in the upper layer from the Sulu Sea through Panay Strait exits via both Tablas and Mindoro Straits. Similarly, it might be argued that the intermediate depth core of southward transport from Tablas Strait (130–250 m) contributes to both the southward maximum in Panay Strait and also to the northward transport through Mindoro Strait over a similar depth range. Below 250 m the transport in each strait is southward, albeit with maximums at different depths ( ). Clearly however, the benthic cores of southward flow in Mindoro and Tablas Straits must sink in the deep Semirara Sea before contributing to the benthic spill‐over into the Sulu Sea via the deeper Panay Strait. Transport Time Series Mean and Variability In this section we discuss the variability observed in the total transport time series for each passage over the three distinct layers evident in the mean transport of profiles of each passage ( and ): an upper layer (0–130 m); an intermediate depth layer (130–250 m) and the benthic layer (250 m – bottom). So as not to seasonally bias the reported annual means, the transports are all reported just for the calendar year 2008, a common and complete deployment period for all moorings ( ). The time series of layer and full‐depth transports during 2008 is presented in , while reports the monthly averaged and total transports. In the upper 130 m, the strongest transports occur in Mindoro Strait. Relatively steady northward transport is found during the SWM and both monsoon transitions, while southward transport during the NEM tends to occur in ∼20 day‐long bursts interspersed with periods of near‐zero transport ( ). Transports during these NEM burst periods can reach 1–2 Sv. In Panay Strait the upper layer transport is primarily northward year‐round ( and ). In 2008, the mean total upper layer transport through Panay Strait was 0.41 Sv away from the Sulu Sea, with approximately two‐thirds flowing northward through Mindoro Strait (0.29 Sv) and one‐third through Tablas Strait (0.14 Sv). At intermediate depths (130–250 m), the total transport through both Panay and Mindoro is highly correlated (r = 0.9, Mindoro leads Panay by 1 day) with relatively strong southward transport into the Sulu Sea beginning in the fall transition (∼October) and continuing through the NEM, and mostly northward transport during the spring and SWM ( ). However, the northward transport is stronger in Mindoro compared to Panay while the reverse is true of the southward transport. As a result the total transport at this intermediate depth range is 0.05 Sv northward in Mindoro and 0.17 Sv southward in Panay. Part of the deficit in the Panay southward transport during the SWM is probably provided by the excess southward transport in the upper layer through Mindoro Strait ( ). Recall that the core of the subsurface southward transport during this season is located higher in the water column in Mindoro compared to Panay ( and ). In Tablas Strait the intermediate depth transport is dominated by intraseasonal variability, with a weak net southward transport of 0.05 Sv. This southward transport in Tablas Strait primarily occurs during the SWM ( ) and, along with the northward transport through Panay Strait ( ), probably contributes to the net northward transport through Mindoro during this season. In the benthic layer (250 m to bottom), the transport time series through Panay and Mindoro Straits again largely track each other ( ), and reflect the strong bottom overflows into the Sulu Sea. The benthic transport is slightly stronger southward in both straits during the fall transition ( ). Interestingly there is a significant correlation (r = −0.7) between Mindoro and Tablas Strait, with Mindoro lagging Tablas by 1 day. The negative correlation suggests that when transport is southward through Mindoro it is northward through Tablas, and vice versa. Recall this deeper layer below 360 m was not directly sampled in Tablas Strait, although the transport estimates for the assumption of a bottom slab layer suggest only weak and variable transport. In addition, there is mostly good agreement between the extrapolated transport estimate for Tablas Strait (solid blue line in ) and the estimate required to balance the bottom transport through Mindoro Strait with the overflow at Panay Strait (dashed blue line in ). Only during the fall transition when the Panay spill‐over is strongest and during the event in late‐February is there a considerable discrepancy between the Panay‐Mindoro residual and the extrapolated transport for Tablas Strait. The total 2008 mean benthic‐layer transport is southward through all straits: −0.41 Sv in Mindoro, −0.11 Sv in Tablas and −0.69 Sv in Panay Strait ( ). As noted, the excess southward transport through Panay Strait (0.17 Sv) may be because of the missing deep contribution through Tablas Strait particularly during the fall transition, and/or the underestimate through Mindoro Strait because the mooring was likely located east of the main benthic core (viz. ). The full‐depth transports show that both Panay and Tablas are near zero during the SWM when Mindoro is primarily northward ( ). During the fall transition and NEM the strong intermediate depth pulses enhance the southward benthic transport and dominate the total transports in Panay and Mindoro. Although significant total transport events over 2 Sv can occur both northward and southward, the mean total transports are very small and southward toward the Sulu Sea. During 2008 the mean and standard deviation of the total transport time series were −0.07 (±1.11) Sv in Mindoro Strait, −0.03 (±0.36) Sv in Tablas Strait and −0.44 (±0.77) Sv in Panay Strait. Our discussion of the total transports through the Philippine Straits is based on calculations assuming a slab layer for the missing bottom layers and extrapolation of the mooring data across the full‐width of the passage. The total transport for the extrapolations that include a constant shear for the bottom layer, and the half‐width and linear cross‐passage schemes is shown in , while the minimum and maximums for the total daily transport time series using the different schemes is shown by the shading in . In Panay and Mindoro Straits there is little difference in the total transports dependent on the choice of fill for the bottom layers ( ) because only the lower 20 m was missing direct velocity measurements in these channels. In contrast, in Tablas Strait the missing lower 200 m of the water column results in an order of magnitude difference in total transport for the full‐width cross‐passage scheme dependent on the use of a slab or shear extrapolation ( ). In Mindoro Strait the total transport of −0.07 Sv using the full‐width scheme lies midway between the estimates using the cross‐passage linear (−0.04 Sv) and half‐width (−0.11 Sv) extrapolation schemes ( ). This is simply a result of the channel geometry: while both the half‐width and full‐width schemes capture the strong bottom flows in this passage, the full‐width scheme also results in more northward transport in the wider upper layer, and this reduces the total full‐width transport estimate compared to the half‐width scheme. Conversely, in Panay Strait, the full‐width total southward transport (−0.44 Sv) is stronger than either the linear (−0.26 Sv) or the half‐width (−0.38 Sv) transport estimates ( ). As in Mindoro Strait this is because of the channel geometry afforded by the full‐width extrapolation, although in the case of Panay Strait the stronger southward transport is because of the increased contribution at intermediate depths during the NEM ( ). Discussion Moorings deployed during the PhilEx field program provide the first time series of observed velocity and properties in the major straits that connect the SCS to the Sulu Sea. The rich and varied time series reveal a complex response to both the surface monsoonal forcing and the bathymetrically controlled deep bottom overflows. Here we discuss the possible dynamics responsible for the observed transports within the three straits. Upper Layer The upper layer circulation within the confluence region of the three passages appears to be very complex. In Mindoro Strait, the seasonal signal is readily apparent with relatively steady northward flow persisting during all of the SWM, while the shorter NEM is characterized by strong southward pulses that last for ∼20 days and are interspersed by periods of weak or slight flow reversal. However, the flow direction is opposite to that expected as due to an Ekman response to the prevailing monsoon winds. This suggests that the upper layer flow in Mindoro Strait may largely be in response to remote wind‐forcing and/or that the Ekman layer is thin and so not well resolved by the ADCP velocity measurements in the very near‐surface layer. In a series of ROMS modeling experiments, found both these reasons to be the case, and suggested that ∼65% of the upper layer transport variance in Mindoro Strait is attributable to remote forcing from both the Pacific Ocean and the SCS, but mostly the latter. Both models [ ; ; etc ] and surface drifter data [ ; ] show surface flow is strongest into the SCS in NEM as a result of a pressure head across Luzon Strait [ ]. However, relatively few surface drifter trajectories show a direct route from Luzon Strait southward along the west coast of Luzon Island [ ; ; ], and no drifter trajectories passed through Mindoro Strait (although this may also be due to unplanned recoveries by fishermen etc.). The positive wind stress curl in NEM results in a basin‐wide cyclonic gyre [ ; ; ] that is also clearly evident in the sea surface height anomalies (SSHa) during 2008 ( ). The southward transport through the upper layer in Mindoro Strait during the NEM therefore could be derived from the southern limb of this gyre. The reason for persistent northward upper‐layer flow in Mindoro Strait during the SWM remains unclear, however most models also report northward or reduced transport during this season [e.g., ; ; ; ; ]. A similar pattern is found for the seasonal upper layer flow through Mindoro Strait in the average 2004–2009 1/12° global HYCOM‐18.2 results [ ]. show the northward flow through Mindoro Strait in SWM is fed by a northward jet along the west coast of Panay, as supported by the surface current climatology of . However, while the mean surface transport in Panay Strait is northward, it does not show the persistent northward flow during the summer monsoon evident in Mindoro Strait ( ), suggesting this jet is not a permanent feature during this period. Nonetheless, it is likely that at times the northward surface transport through Mindoro in the SWM is fed by both northward flow from Panay Strait, and perhaps also by southward surface flow through Tablas Strait that is stronger during the early part of this monsoon phase ( and ). Regional wind‐forcing may play an additional role in the upper layer transport variability within each strait. Mountain gaps along the Philippine archipelago result in alternating bands of positive and negative wind stress curl from north to south within the eastern SCS and Sulu Sea during the NEM ( , , and ) that respectively spin‐up pairs of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies [ ; ; ]. Upper layer transport (0–130 m) in Mindoro Strait is significantly correlated (r = −0.7) with the wind stress curl of the region in the southeast SCS just west of Mindoro Island: the positive wind stress curl pattern and the resulting cross‐strait sea level gradient ( , , and ) results in southward flow through Mindoro Strait. Furthermore, found that wind stress surges characterized by a more easterly component are associated with stronger southward flow through Mindoro Strait, while surges with a more northerly component disrupt the geostrophic balance and lead to more northward flow through the strait. The wind surges are typically separated by 12–17 days [ , ] consistent with the duration of the transport pulses observed in the upper layer through Mindoro Strait during the NEM ( ). Similarly, local winds can shift the location of the jets and eddies also prevalent in the northeastern Sulu Sea [ ; ; ], and subsequently lead to the intermittent reversals and more variable upper layer transport observed in both Panay and Tablas passages. Intermediate Depths Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the transport time series is the strong southward flows observed at intermediate depth in Mindoro and Panay Straits ( and ). Both Mindoro and Panay show the strong southward pulses at ∼200–300 m depth beginning in October 2008 with opposing (Mindoro) or weak (Panay) flow found in the upper layer. As the NEM reaches its peak, these subsurface pulses gradually strengthen and shoal to occur near the bottom of the thermocline at 100–200 m depth in Mindoro Strait ( ) and 130–230 m in Panay Strait ( ). The shallower cores at Mindoro Strait may possibly be a result of the mooring being located east of the main flow through this passage. Occasionally the pulses are connected to the strong southward flows found in the benthic layer of both straits (e.g., January 2009). Since these pulses occur during both of the fall to NEM sampled during the 2007–2009 mooring deployment period it appears likely that they are related to the large‐scale monsoonal forcing. While southward flow occurs over similar depth ranges in Tablas Strait ( ), the flow is considerably weaker and can occur during any month of the year, and hence the Sibuyan Sea is unlikely to be a source of this variability. Furthermore, the intermediate depth range rules out a direct Pacific source as it is well below the shallow sill depth of San Bernardino Strait. Indeed, the T‐S properties in Mindoro Strait show this southward flow during fall and NEM is associated with inflow of the saltier and warmer Subtropical Lower Water mass from the SCS ( ). Thus, it appears most likely that the SCS is the source of the southward pulses during the fall and NEM. The time series of intermediate depth (130–250 m) transport in Panay Strait ( ) shows significant correlation with SSHa within the SCS ( ). Similar correlation patterns are found for the 0–130 m and 130–250 m transport time series in Mindoro Strait (not shown). The correlation patterns are of the sense that negative correlations correspond to high SSHa and southward transport through the strait. The fall transition from the SWM to the NEM marks the strongest change in the annual wind stress cycle in the SCS [ ]. The wind reversal develops first in the northern SCS in September, raising the local sea level and setting up an alongshore pressure gradient forcing the southwestward propagation of coastally trapped waves along the western boundary of the SCS [ ; ]. Off the coast of Vietnam, the southwest current meets a surface‐intensified northward coastal jet that is present here during the SWM and prevents further southward flow, but rather the current turns eastward to cross the SCS as an undercurrent at depths centered on 200–300 m [ ]. This Southeast Vietnam Offshore Current is associated with the dipole structure of SSHa persistently observed in September and October between 11° and 14°N in the western basin ( ) [ ; ]. Given that these latitudes correspond to the entrance into the Sulu Sea via Mindoro Strait, it may be that this subsurface eastward jet is the source of the southward intermediate flow observed over the same 200–300 m depth range in these passages during this fall transition. As the NEM progresses, the stronger positive wind stress curl results in a basin‐wide cyclonic gyre with anomalously high SSHa around the perimeter of the SCS ( ) that strengthens the southward western boundary current [ ; ]. While some of this current contributes to the higher throughflow into Karimata Strait during the NEM [ ; ], the high SSH along the northeast coast of Borneo ( and ) suggests that some of this flow continues eastward. The continuity of high sea level through both Balabac Strait into the western part of the Sulu Sea, as well as along the Palawan island chain into Mindoro Strait, suggests there may be further partitioning of this flow through both channels ( ). Unfortunately there are no direct current observations in the vicinity of Balabac Strait as yet to confirm this circulation pattern, although the sea level (through geostrophy) and model results offer some support [e.g., ]. Thus it appears likely that the cyclonic gyre circulation within the SCS during the NEM results in the strong intermediate depth southward flow observed through Mindoro and Panay Straits, although what causes the shoaling of the southward flow from the fall transition to the NEM is less certain. In their model, suggest that during the dynamic adjustment to long westward Rossby waves excited at the eastern boundary of the SCS during the monsoon reversals result in the propagation of coastally trapped Kelvin waves around the perimeter of the SCS. The shoaling of the southward flow may possibly be a signal of the upward phase propagation of these waves leaking into the Sulu Sea. The pulse‐like nature of the southward flow may be related to surges in the wind field within the SCS or perhaps time‐variations in the pressure head that drives the flow from the western Pacific through Luzon Strait [ ]. Targeted model experiments are required to help further diagnose the suspected controlling forces. The isolated northward transport reversals evident in February–March 2008 and again in mid‐May 2008 also have the characteristic upward phase propagation associated with Kelvin waves. In this case it is likely that the Rossby wave energy from the western Pacific Ocean boundary has been converted into coastal Kelvin wave energy that propagates around the Philippine archipelago. Saltier water was associated with northward flow at 312‐m depth in Mindoro Strait ( ) and at this depth, northward flow only occurs during the isolated events in February–March and May 2008 ( ). The saltier water is sourced from intermediate depths in the Sulu Sea [ ; ] supporting the notion of upward phase propagation as the Kelvin wave passes along the eastern Sulu Sea. In the BRAN data‐assimilating model, tracked Kelvin wave signals northward along the waveguide of the eastern edge of the Sulu Sea through Panay and Mindoro Straits to reach the northern tip of Luzon Island. Kelvin wave pathways into the Sulu Sea from the Pacific can be either via Sibutu Passage from the Sulawesi Sea, or directly through Dipolog or San Bernardino Straits ( ). All these straits, as well as the three straits measured as part of this study have passage widths much smaller than the mean baroclinic Rossby deformation radius which ranges from 100 to 150 km at these latitudes [ ]. The propagation pathways, frequency of the Kelvin wave events and their relationship to Pacific forcing are the subject of future analysis. The Benthic Layer Bottom intensified flows are evident in both Mindoro and Panay Straits. Earlier studies suggested that these benthic overflows might be episodic turbidity currents related to cyclone activity in the SCS [ ; ], although more recent analysis demonstrated the transport is hydraulically controlled, at least in Panay Strait [ ]. In this paper, bottom temperature time series showed substantial variability over the deployment period, with a range of >2°C in Mindoro Strait and ∼0.5°C in Panay and Tablas Strait. The stronger variability in the Mindoro Strait bottom temperature may be a function of the seasonal change in thermocline depth of the SCS that shoals and upwells colder water during the NEM with the reverse occurring during the SWM. On the same isopycnal, showed that SCS T‐S properties, the source of the NPIW overflow in Mindoro, were cooler and fresher than those observed on the sill in Panay Strait. Thus, even though the sill depth is shallower at Mindoro (∼440 m) compared to Panay (∼560 m), the coolest temperature observed at Mindoro was >0.5°C cooler than the coldest temperature recorded in the Panay time series ( ). This was particularly the case during episodes of stronger southward flow. While at Tablas (with a similar sill depth to Panay), the sill temperatures were typically 0.5°C warmer than at Panay. This suggests that the cooler (and fresher) Mindoro Strait overflow waters mix within the Semirara Sea with the much warmer (and saltier) waters exiting over the deeper sill in Tablas Strait before overflowing Panay Strait. This supports the idea that mixing and warming of the cooler SCS overflow water occurs relatively quickly after water plunges over the sills [ ]. Conclusions The mean annual transports from the SCS into the Sulu Sea during 2008 were very small, of O(0.1) Sv, even though individual transport events of O(1) Sv were observed in all depth layers and could occur at any time of the year. Our best transport estimates give −0.07 (±1.11) Sv in Mindoro Strait and −0.03 (±0.36) Sv in Tablas Strait with −0.44 (±0.77) Sv exiting through Panay Strait. It is clear that although the variability is strong, there is little balance in the total transports during our 2008 survey year. Based on the discussion above, the discrepancy appears mainly due the stronger southward transport in Panay Strait at intermediate depth during the NEM ( ) and in the benthic transport during the fall transition ( ). These discrepancies may be due to the sub‐optimal position of the Mindoro mooring east of the main channel not capturing the strongest southward flow in both layers. While the extrapolated transport for the missing Tablas observations at depth generally agrees with the Panay‐Mindoro residual transport ( ), thus supporting a small benthic contribution from Tablas, it is likely that there is significant deep southward benthic flow occurring through Tablas Strait in fall. The PhilEx mooring deployment period in 2008 coincided with a reasonably strong La Niña that peaked during February–March 2008, so it is reasonable to ask how “typical” are these transport estimates. The high‐resolution modeling study by showed stronger southward flow through Mindoro Strait during 2004, an El Niño year, compared to 2008. The main difference between the 2004 and 2008 Mindoro Strait model transports appears to be the lack of northward transport in the surface layer during the SWM, but rather in 2004 the annual cycle is dominated by the stronger southward flows such as characterize the NEM in 2008. The model and observed annual mean SSHa during 2004 (2008) is anomalously low (high) throughout the SCS and Sulu Sea ( ) (see also Figure 3 of ). Thus it may be that the mechanisms suggested above as responsible for the observed northward flow during the 2008 SWM – regional wind‐eddy processes in the Sulu Sea and the summer anti‐cyclonic gyre set‐up in the central SCS – are enhanced during La Niña years, and conversely, much diminished during El Niño years. Various studies suggest there is stronger Luzon Strait transport and weaker Kuroshio transport during El Niño years as a result of the northward shift of the NEC bifurcation [ ; ; ; ]. The situation is reversed during La Niña years. Thus it appears likely that the relatively weak transports observed to enter the Sulu Sea from the SCS during the 2008 mooring deployment are a result of the coincident strong La Niña event.

Non‐sea‐salt (nss) sulfate (SO 4 2− ) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in aerosols, two major aerosol species in the marine atmosphere, are primarily derived from the oxidation of dimethylsulfide (DMS) produced by marine phytoplankton [ ; ; ; ]. These S‐containing aerosols could be an important source of cloud condensation nuclei in unpolluted marine atmosphere such as that of the Southern Ocean [ ] and may interact with incoming solar radiation, affecting cloud microphysics and consequently climate [ ; ]. Although the DMS emissions from marine organisms represent a major natural source for nss‐sulfate in the marine atmosphere, nss‐sulfate may also originate from other sources, such as volcanic emissions, stratospheric injection [ ; ; ; ; ] and anthropogenic emissions, in particular fossil fuel burning in the northern hemisphere [ ; ; ]. Nss‐sulfate from such sources may arrive to the high latitude regions in Northern Hemisphere through long‐range transport. In contrast to nss‐sulfate, however, the only atmospheric source of MSA is considered to be the oxidation of DMS, and thus, MSA has been proposed as a useful tracer to separate sulfate of marine biogenic origin from other sources [ ; ]. Many studies have provided valuable results on the spatial and temporal characteristics of MSA and nss‐sulfate in various oceanic regions [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ], including Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE1) [ ; ], Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) Tropics and the Pacific Atmospheric Sulfur Experiment (PASE) [ ]. The concentrations of aerosol MSA in high‐latitude regions, may reflect the level of the marine biogenic production. The fluctuations in the MSA concentrations in the ice cores have been used as records of marine primary production to investigate climate history [ ; ; ], as high MSA concentrations during the last glacial period suggest an increase in oceanic DMS emissions and this in turn suggests that the S cycle has been sensitive to climate change. However, the MSA concentrations in the marine atmosphere could be affected by multiple processes relating to primary productivity, such as spatial variations of phytoplankton species, air‐sea exchange rates of DMS, and different oxidation pathways of DMS. In addition, variations in environmental conditions such as temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea‐ice conditions, winds and ocean currents could also affect the concentrations of MSA. All these parameters are intimately linked through the complex interactions of the climate system [ ]. Because of the importance of the S cycles and Antarctica in the global climate system, many efforts were made focusing on understanding sulfur chemistry involving DMS and its effects on the climate in the Antarctic regions; major experiments include: The Sulfur Chemistry in the Antarctic Troposphere Experiment [ ; ], Investigation of Sulfur Chemistry in the Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT) [ ; ], and Antarctic Tropospheric Chemistry Investigation (ANTCI) [ ; ]. Marine biogenic sources dominate the sulfur budget while the contributions from the long‐range transport and stratospheric reservoir remains weak in this region [ ]. Although MSA and nss‐SO 4 2− were correlated based on these studies, the data sets are not sufficiently robust to draw a quantitative conclusion concerning the fraction of marine biogenic nss‐SO 4 2− in the region [ ]. The ANTCI mean nss‐sulfate (124 ng m −3 ) and MSA (9.1 ng m −3 ) concentrations were comparable to those during ISCAT, but the high concentrations of MSA and sodium and high MSA/sulfate ratios in late November/early December indicated pervasive maritime influences during that time [ ]. The modes of nss‐sulfate and MSA obtained during the cruise over the Atlantic Ocean to the Antarctic site Aboa in November–December 1999 indicated that aerosol particles were internally mixed [ ]. The ambient conditions, such as temperature, may also affect the observed MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios, as reported by that an inverse correlation between air temperature and MSA/ nss‐SO 4 2− ratios was observed during their cruise from 20°N to 60°S in the Pacific Ocean, with the ratios being increased while air temperature decreased toward the high southern latitudes, and that was in agreement with the results of laboratory studies on the MSA‐temperature dependent theory. Other studies conducted through research cruises and aircrafts reveal the latitudinal variations of DMS and MSA, showing changes in the atmospheric concentrations of DMS and MSA near the equator and in the higher southern latitudes [ ; ; ; ; ; ]. These studies provided important results on the processes controlling the formation of S‐containing species in the remote marine atmosphere around coastal Antarctica and on the Antarctic Plateau. However, data on the latitudinal distributions of the key S species, in particular the comparison between the sub‐Antarctic and the Arctic regions, remain insufficient. Here we present the results of atmospheric MSA, nss‐sulfate, and selected inorganic species in aerosol particles collected from eight cruises from Shanghai, China to both Antarctica and the Arctic. We characterized the concentrations of these species in the marine atmospheric boundary layers from 78°N to 70°S. Our goal was to investigate the spatial distributions of these important S‐containing species and to explore the possible mechanisms of their formation in the high latitude regions. Results from this work will add new data to the global database of MSA and nss‐sulfate. We hope that our results may also encourage more explorations for additional sources of MSA beside the DMS source toward a better understanding of the atmosphere‐marine ecosystem interactions. Materials and Methods A total of 164 aerosol samples were collected on R/V Xue Long during five Antarctic (ANT) and three Arctic (ARC) cruises during the Chinese National Antarctic and Arctic Research Expeditions (CHINARE). Although the Antarctic cruises normally started in November and ended in early April of the next year, most of aerosol samples on these cruises were collected between December and February (austral summer). The Arctic cruises were carried out during the period of July–September ( and ). Thus the results from these cruises allow determine the summer‐time characteristics of aerosol distributions over both Antarctica and the Arctic. Bulk aerosol samples were collected by a high‐volume bulk sampler Model M241 with wind direction and speed controller (University of Miami, USA) that was installed on the upper deck of R/V Xue Long. Samples were collected on 20 × 25 cm Whatman41 filters for ∼48 h, with a sampling flow rate of ∼1 m 3 min −1 . A wind direction and speed controller was used during sampling to avoid possible contamination from the ship stack emissions. One sixteenth of the filters was rinsed with 5 ml of deionized water and leached overnight. The cations were analyzed with a CS12A analytical column, and the anions were analyzed with an AG11‐HC guard column and an AS11‐HC analytical column, using a Dionex DX‐500 ion chromatograph (IC) system. Sample injections were done through the use of a 100 μ l sample loop. The IC method detection limits are <0.05 mg l −1 for major anions including sulfate and MSA and for major cations including Na + . The blank values of the filters were subtracted from the measurements of air filter samples. The concentrations of nss‐SO 4 2− were calculated through the use of the equation: [nss‐SO 4 −2 ] = [SO 4 −2 ] total − [Na + ] × 0.25, where 0.25 is the mass ratio of SO 4 2− /Na + in seawater [ ]. Results and Discussions Latitudinal Distributions of Aerosol MSA and nss‐SO 4 2− The latitudinal distributions of aerosol MSA obtained during the CHINARE‐Arctic Cruises I in 1999, II in 2003, and III in 2008 were similar ( ). The concentrations of aerosol MSA stayed at low levels (0.0013 to 0.050 μ g m −3 ) from ∼30°N to ∼50°N and reached its highest value of approximately 0.11 μ g m −3 at 50°N in Cruise I and 57°N in Cruises II, and 0.19 at 58°N in Cruise III ( ). These results were consistent with previous observations, such as those by who observed the highest MSA concentration of 0.097 μ g m −3 at Shemya (52°N) among several islands in the North Pacific. As the exclusive source of MSA, DMS also showed high concentrations at the sea surface in this region reported by and re‐confirmed later by and . The MSA concentrations, however, had different latitudinal patterns in the southern hemisphere. The MSA concentrations were 0.011 μ g m −3 near the equator and increased to 0.16 μ g m −3 at ∼55°S, followed by a sharp increase. The MSA concentrations reached the highest levels near the Antarctic continent (60–70°S), which is consistent with recent results from the cruise conducted during Nov 2010–Feb 2011 (Y. Gao, unpublished data, 2012). The maximum MSA value of 0.26 μ g m −3 was observed on December 29 at ∼63°S, 23°W during ANT 18th cruise. The next highest value of MSA, 0.24 μ g m −3 , was observed on January 22 at 68°S, 18°W during the ANT 21st cruise. Both occurred in mid austral summer. The air mass back trajectory analyses indicated that the air masses arriving at the above locations on those dates were from the western Antarctic coastal regions, in particular the Antarctic Peninsula. Western Antarctica is undergoing dramatic climate changes, with temperature being rising during the past half century, resulting in the shortened sea ice seasons and accelerated glacier losses [ ; ]. Biological processes are often enhanced, associated with the melting of the ice, as seen with the elevated levels of chlorophyll in the surface waters observed via satellite imagery in polynya areas [ ]. Therefore the observed high MSA concentrations in the mid‐austral summer in western Antarctica from this study may reflect the enhanced marine biological activities driven by the environmental changes in that region. However, MSA concentrations as low as 5 ng m −3 were found over Antarctica's marginal seas in the CHINARE‐Antarctic cruises. These results are consistent with the cruise from UK to Antarctica in October 1992 to January 1993 where the maximum MSA concentration varied from 2 ng m −3 to 0.36 μ g m −3 near 75°S [ ]. However, during the cruise from USA to Antarctica in 1989, the concentrations of MSA varied from 3 ng m −3 to 0.07 μ g m −3 , with the highest concentrations occurring at 15°N and from 30° to 40°S, while at latitudes south of 40°S, MSA slightly decreased and reached 0.03 μ g m −3 near 60°S [ ]. The maximum concentrations of MSA were also observed at Dumont D'Urville (66.39°S, 140°W), Halley (75.35°S, 26.34°W) and Neumayer (79.40°S, 8.16°W), approximately 0.075, 0.15 and 0.35 μ g m −3 , respectively [ ]. The differences of MSA between these stations might be due to the variations of different factors such as biological productivity, climatology of the regions, sea ice coverage, etc [ ]. The MSA maximum from the CHINARE cruises was within the maxima observed at these stations. The concentrations of nss‐SO 4 2− stayed at relatively low levels during the cruises in this study, with >80% of the values below 1 μ g m −3 and 16% of the rest of the values ranging from 1 to 5 μ g m −3 in both hemispheres ( ). In the northern hemisphere, however, the highest values of nss‐SO 4 2− (22, 21 and 12 μ g m −3 ) which are not included in , were observed near the starting pier (Shanghai, China). Results of air mass back‐trajectory analyses clearly showed that the air masses affecting these high nss‐SO 4 2− values passed over urban regions in northeastern China, suggesting the influences of pollution emissions in land on the nss‐SO 4 2− levels in the coastal marine atmosphere. Earlier studies also revealed that the maximum atmospheric nss‐SO 4 2− concentrations exceeded 40 μ g m −3 at coastal Qingdao in East China Sea and 20 μ g m −3 at coastal Xiamen in South China [ ]. These values agreed with the results from recent studied in Shanghai city and the North Yellow Sea [ ; ], reflecting the contributions of pollution emissions in the continent on the nss‐SO 4 2− concentrations in the marine atmosphere in this region, although the DMS emissions in China's marginal seas could also be a source for nss‐sulfate in the region [ ]. The nss‐SO 4 2− concentrations decreased as the Xue Long Vessel moved away from the China mainland. The other high nss‐SO 4 2− concentrations during the Arctic cruises were 5.6 μ g m −3 observed during Arctic I and 5.0 μ g m −3 observed during Arctic II around 64–65°N at the entrance of the Bering Sea toward the Chukchi Sea. These high values of nss‐sulfate concentrations at these areas were affected by air masses passing over North America as identified by air mass back trajectory analyses, and these results also suggest the influences of anthropogenic emissions in the continents on the atmospheric concentrations of nss‐sulfate in Northern Hemisphere. These results from this study are consistent with both earlier and recent studies. used a global atmospheric transport–chemistry model to estimate the changes in the distributions of tropospheric sulphate aerosol occurred since pre‐industrial times, and found human activities have increased global emissions of sulphur gases during the past century, leading to increased sulphate aerosol concentrations, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. They noticed that the increase in sulphate aerosol concentration was small over the Southern Hemisphere oceans. showed the long range transport of pollution associated with Arctic Haze based on their 30‐years aerosol measurements conducted at Barrow, Alaska, and indicated that the anthropogenic emissions in East Asia and North America have already had long lasting impacts on the atmospheric composition in Northern Hemisphere. Because a fraction of nss‐sulfate in the Northern Hemisphere comes from anthropogenic emission that is different from the Southern Hemisphere, this may contribute to the different MSA/nss‐sulfate ratios in the two hemispheres. Our back‐trajectory analyses results also indicate that in Northern Hemisphere in general, the air masses reaching the ship mainly came from East Asia for low and midlatitudes and from Eurasia or the Arctic Ocean for high latitudes, which is different from those in southern hemisphere that were mainly from the oceans or the Antarctic continent. These differences in air mass source regions could also contribute to the observed latitudinal variations of nss‐sulfate. Distributions of MSA/nss‐Sulfate Ratios The MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios from the two hemispheres obtained in this study showed different patterns ( ). In the southern hemisphere, the patterns of MSA/nssSO 4 2− ratios were similar to those of MSA ( ). The MSA/nss‐SO 4 −2 increased slowly from the tropic region to the midlatitude, and approximately at 50°S, the ratios increased dramatically. The MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios were approximately 0.0024–0.06 in the tropical regions and 0.06–0.12 in the unpolluted midlatitudes and increased sharply near coastal Antarctica, ranging from 0.15 to 0.93. The highest ratio, 0.93, was observed at 62°S, 4°E around 31 December 2001 during the ANT 18th cruise, while the concentration of nss‐SO 4 2− was 0.19 μ g m −3 that was at the lower end of the nss‐SO 4 2− concentration range. Based on the air mass back‐trajectory analyses, the aerosol sample with this low nss‐SO 4 2− concentration was affected by air masses from the inland of Eastern Antarctica, suggesting the minimum production of sulfate aerosol from marine biogenic sources in the region. The latitudinal variations of this ratio were similar to those by other studies at different oceanic regions, with higher values at high latitudes [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ]. Results from Mawson, Antarctica (67°36′S, 62°30′E) from February 1987 to October 1989 showed that MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− was about 0.31 (about five times higher than that observed over the tropical and subtropical oceans), with DMS being considered as the main source for MSA and nss‐SO 4 2− [ ]. In the cruise from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the Antarctic in 1989, the molar ratio of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ranged from 0.2 near the equator to 0.32 at 55°S. The pattern repeatedly observed in the CHINARE‐Antarctica cruises confirmed a unique feature in spatial variations of atmospheric MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios. In the northern hemisphere, although the increases in MSA/nss‐sulfate ratios were found in high latitudes, the increase in this ratio from 0.0031 at midlatitudes to the maximum of 0.39 (68°N, 169°W) were not as dramatic as those found in the high latitudes of Southern Hemisphere. This pattern of relatively low MSA/nss‐sulfate ratios observed during the CHINARE Arctic cruises could be attributed to the influence of air masses containing anthropogenic sulfate from nearby continents. The lowest MSA/nss‐sulfate ratio of 0.0051 among all air samples collected during the Arctic cruises was associated with the air sample collected near 60°N, 177°E toward the end of August 1999, corresponding to the highest nss‐sulfate concentration of 5.6 μ g m −3 . Air mass back trajectory analyses indicate that this sample was impacted by air masses passing over Russia on the east of Bering Sea and the Bering Strait, suggesting the anthropogenic contributions from the continents to the observed high nss‐sulfate concentration at this location. Another low MSA/nss sulfate ratio of 0.013 from the Arctic cruise air samples was also associated with high nss‐sulfate concentration of 5.0 μ g m −3 from the sample collected near 59°N, 175°E in September 2004 with similar continental impacts as indicated by air mass back trajectory analyses. This finding from the CHINARE Arctic cruises is consistent with the results from several recent studies in the Arctic [ ; ; ], showing that the nss‐sulfate over the Arctic was often influenced by contributions from continental sources. On the other hand, the high values of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− observed during the CHINARE Arctic cruises were different from those found in other oceanic regions in Northern Hemisphere. Over the North Atlantic, the ratios of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− were 0.053 at Barbados (13°N, 59°W), 0.051 at Bermuda (32°N, 65°W), and 0.33 at Mace Head, Ireland (53°N, 10°W) [ ]. At Alert, Canada (83°N, 62°W), the MSA to nss‐SO 4 2− ratios ranged from 0.006 to 0.02, with the highest value occurring in summer, similar to the results observed over the midlatitude regions [ ; ]. On the other hand, the patterns of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios and of MSA concentrations observed during CHINARE‐Arctic cruises were similar ( and ), with the highest MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− occurring from 40°N–68°N where sea surface DMS and air MSA concentrations were highest [ ]. During the three CHINARE‐Arctic cruises there were no strong correlations (R 2 = 0.091, n = 40) between the MSA concentrations and MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios. However, a stronger correlation (r 2 = 0.43, n = 60) between the two was observed in the southern hemisphere during five CHINARE‐Antarctica cruises ( ). Although the variations of aerosol nss‐SO 4 2− in the northern hemisphere are influenced by more complex sources as compared to the southern hemisphere, the concentrations of nss‐SO 4 2− at the high latitudes of both hemispheres from this study varied, with higher values being associated with air masses of continental origins. After removing the nss‐SO 4 2− values associated with air masses affected by anthropogenic sources, the variation in the MSA concentrations seems to be the major cause for large differences in the ratios of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− between the two hemispheres. Possibly the higher MSA concentrations near Antarctica may lead to the higher MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios observed in that region, although this is not a simple linear relationship. The three lowest MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios, 0.059 from the ANT 16th cruise, 0.040 from the ANT 18th cruise, 0.054 from the ANT 19th cruise, were observed in the Antarctic coastal waters, and all were associated with relatively low MSA concentrations (0.033, 0.023, 0.024 μ g m −3 , respectively). This result suggests the important role of MSA in shaping the spatial variation in MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− in the southern hemisphere. This result is consistent with the results by who found that it is MSA more than sulfate that drives the spatial differences in this ratio. Factors Influencing the Distributions of MSA and MSA/nssSO 4 2− Ratios The significantly high ratios of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− found near coastal Antarctica have been considered mainly to be due to the oxidation of marine biogenic DMS at low temperatures [ ; ; ; ]. The high strength of the DMS source and the temperature‐dependent kinetics of MSA formation have been used to explain not only the DMS ‐ MSA relationships but also the inverse relationship between MSA concentration and the ambient temperature, as lower temperature may lead to higher yield of MSA [ ; ]. Hence, at certain temperatures, the ratios of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− may probably remain at certain values. Since the temperature patterns of the northern and southern hemispheres are similar as shown in , similar patterns of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− should be expected in both hemispheres if DMS is the main source of both MSA and nss‐SO 4 2− . However, neither the MSA concentrations nor the MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios showed similarities with air temperature in the two hemispheres. In the Arctic regions, the highest MSA values shown in were not associated with the lowest temperature shown in , and the correlation between MSA and air temperature was weak, with R 2 being equal to 0.033. The high values of MSA concentrations occurred in the areas with high DMS emission at the sea surface, but these values were not related to the low air temperature while aerosol sampling took place. During the ANT cruises, the MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios varied from 0.024 to 0.93 in the high southern latitudes ( ), but strong relationships between MSA concentrations or MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− and air temperature during aerosol sampling were not found ( ). For example, during the 18th CHINARE‐Antarctica cruise, the sampling temperature near the maritime Antarctic normally ranged from −5°C to 0°C to ( ), with MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− varying from 0.13 to 0.94 ( ). The maximum value of MSA was obtained at −2.00°C while the maximum MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratio of 0.94 was obtained at −1.36°C, and both were not associated with the lowest temperature (−5°C) ( and ). The correlations were R 2 = 0.18 between MSA and air temperature and R 2 = 0.099 between MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− and air temperature for the ANT‐SH data, indicating weak relationships among them. On the other hand, as the air temperature along the paths of air masses indicated by trajectory analyses fluctuated only within a range of −5°C to 0°C for most of samples collected in coastal Antarctica based on which this MSA/nss‐ SO 4 2− temperature relationship was addressed, such small variation in air temperature may not be sufficient to observe a significant correlation with air temperature. Thus the air temperature variation within such a scale did not appear to be a main factor influencing the changes of MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios in coastal Antarctica. The robustness of the theory of the MSA production mechanism at low temperature has been questioned by other studies. The DMS‐MSA relationship in the high latitudes in the southern hemisphere is not linear. found that nss‐SO 4 2− peaks in the December–January period, and MSA reaches a maximum a little later and then subsequently drops rapidly; the highest ratio of MSA to nss‐SO 4 2− molar ratios appeared around the March/April equinox period. also observed abrupt changes in the MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratio during summer but with no concomitant changes in temperature in coastal Antarctica. The MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios in coastal Antarctica during the summer months were 3–10 times higher than those obtained on the Antarctic plateau where the temperature is much lower than coastal Antarctica [ ; ; ], although this may be attributed to possible processes where aerosol MSA tends to be more rapidly depleted than nss‐SO 4 2− during the transport from the coast to the plateau. High summertime DMS concentrations have been observed in seawater and marine atmosphere near coastal Antarctica due to the retreat of the sea‐ice and the blooming of algae (especially DMSP‐rich species) [ ; ], which may give high production of MSA. However, as described by , the DMS concentrations at Neumayer were enhanced by one order of magnitude from December to January, while nss‐SO 4 2− and MSA increased by only ∼30% and a factor of 2, respectively. Thus the overall nss‐SO 4 2− and MSA levels observed in summer at coastal Antarctic sites may not be necessarily controlled by local DMS emissions and ambient temperature [ ; ]. These results with the MSA/nss‐SO 4 2− ratios consistently showing summer maxima and winter minima raised questions about the robustness of the theory of the MSA production mechanism of MSA being preferentially produced under low temperatures. On the other hand, diminished marine biological activity and low seawater DMS conditions in winter have widely been cited as the cause of this observed trend. proposed that as the photochemical production of hydroxyl radical (OH) during the dark winter at polar latitudes is non‐existent, reduced wintertime oxidation of DMS by OH to form MSA results in summer maxima and winter minima in MSA concentrations in these regions. In addition, in the cruise from USA to the Antarctica in 1989, no significant spatial correlation was found between the latitudinal distributions of DMS, SO 2 , MSA, and nss‐SO 4 2− [ ]. A similar conclusion was drawn from the study of another cruise carried out from UK to Antarctica in 1992 that good correlations did not exist between individual DMS‐MSA data pairs, although broad agreements were seen in the atmospheric concentrations of DMS and MSA [ ; ]. Results from this study and previous studies suggest that the DMS source and temperature‐dependent kinetics of MSA formation cannot fully explain the variations of the MSA distributions, particularly while comparing the data from the maritime Antarctic with those in the Arctic. The production of aerosol MSA seemed to be influenced by more complex factors in addition to air temperature, such as the atmospheric concentration of DMS, the DMS oxidation rate, factors controlling DMS emissions from the sea surface, etc. In fact, it is even difficult to justify a linear relationship between air temperature and MSA/nss‐sulfate ratio as this ratio could be affected by anthropogenic emissions, particularly in the northern hemisphere, or between DMS and MSA as the concentrations of MSA and nss‐sulfate from DMS are influenced differently by the production and oxidation rates of a variety of intermediate reaction products, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulfone (DMSO 2 ), methane sulfinic acid (MSIA), methylsulfenic acid (MSEA), and SO 2 ; at present, it is difficult to evaluate the roles of these intermediate products on the reactions that produce MSA and nss‐sulfate [ ; ]. In addition to the competition between OH addition to and hydrogen abstraction from DMS, the decomposition of CH 3 SO 2 and reaction to form CH 3 SO 3 have been proposed to be an additional factor controlling the observed temperature dependence of the MSA/nss‐sulfate ratios. On the other hand, the production rates of DMS are dependent of different groups of phytoplankton and could be affected by different regional nutrient levels [ ], and these may also contribute to the different distributions of the MSA and nss‐sulfate concentrations and MSA/nss‐sulfate ratios. Alternative Source of MSA Near Antarctica For sources of S‐containing species in the Antarctic coastal air, in addition to the emission of marine DMS, volcanic emissions, etc., contributions from sea animals, in particular penguins, to the sulfur cycles near coastal Antarctica are possible. detected certain organosulfur compounds in the volatile components of fresh penguin feces, including dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), dimethyl tetrasulfide (DMTTS), and dimethyl pentasulfide (DMPS), and their results indicated that organosulfur compounds from fresh penguin feces had been emitted into the air, contributing to the S‐containing species over Antarctica. They further estimated that 5.5 × 10–5 nmol m −3 sulfur emission to the atmosphere could be inferred from each penguin, accounting for 5–15% of the total Nss‐sulfur emissions near Zhong Shan Station (69°S, 76°E) in Antarctica [ ]. observed that near Dumont D'Urville on Ile des Petrels near coastal Antarctica, a place with a penguin population of 12,000, the concentrations of nss‐SO 4 2− were 3.77 nmol m −3 for a downwind location and 3.11 nmol m −3 for an upwind location. In this study, two of the three highest MSA concentrations, 0.26 μ g m −3 observed during the ANT 18th cruise and 0.24 μ g m −3 observed during the ANT 21th cruise in austral summer, were affected by air masses originating from sub‐Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsula ( ), where large populations of Antarctic penguins species live. These results support the idea that Antarctic penguins may contribute to atmospheric S‐containing compounds in the region. The breeding seasons of sea animals are broadly consistent with those of algae blooms, and therefore the contributions from penguins to the MSA concentrations in the air may need to be considered. Large population of seabirds, in particular penguins, is a unique feature in the Antarctic ecosystem that is different from that of the Arctic [ ], and this ecological difference may partially explain the different levels of atmospheric MSA in the two high latitude regions. The volatile organosulfur compounds, such as DMDS, DMTS, DMTTS, and DMPS, in the feces of penguins in coastal Antarctica as detected by , which have higher S content in their molecules than that of DMS, may be converted to MSA in some ways, and might contribute to the observed high MSA levels in aerosols over coastal Antarctica. At present, however, the reaction pathways for MSA production from sea animal feces are uncertain and investigations focusing on the production pathways from these organosulfur compounds to MSA are few. Therefore, additional field work and laboratory kinetic studies relating to possible marine animal sources for MSA should be explored to better understand the sulfur chemistry in coastal Antarctica. Additionally, certain environmental factors, such as winds, sea ice coverage, and light intensity, etc., may also contribute to the variability of S‐species in the high latitude marine atmosphere and should be considered through future studies.

Gross terrestrial C exchanges (i.e., assimilation and respiration) with the atmosphere are more than ten times larger than current anthropogenic fossil fuel CO 2 emissions [ ], implying that small errors in terrestrial exchange estimates can result in relatively large errors in predicted atmospheric CO 2 levels. There are a number of approaches to estimating terrestrial C exchanges: (1) “bottom‐up” approaches using spatial scaling with distributed surface flux measurements [ ] or forest and agricultural inventories; (2) bottom‐up approaches that attempt to mechanistically model the various processes producing and consuming CO 2 ; (3) “top‐down,” or inverse, approaches that use atmospheric concentration measurements, atmospheric transport fields, and (in some cases) a priori surface exchange estimates; and (4) estimates based on remotely sensed properties of the land surface. The many examples of these approaches span a large range of mechanistic detail, temporal and spatial resolution, and extent of testing and comparison with independent measurements. Many “bottom‐up” models have been developed to integrate the processes responsible for gross and net terrestrial C exchanges and their relationships with climate [e.g., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ]. These models span a large range of integration of mechanistic understanding, from simple regression models based on local climate to complex representations of molecular‐level exchanges. Model testing has typically been performed using field‐scale observations from, for example, soil respiration chamber and eddy covariance measurements. There have also been models developed specifically for cropped systems, including DSSAT [ ] and Agro‐IBIS [ ]. Some of these land surface models have been integrated in regional [e.g., ; ; ] and global [ ] climate models. However, there remains a substantial gap between the scales at which these models are applied and the scales at which they were developed and tested. An important concern in bottom‐up model applications is how surface heterogeneity in land cover type and status is taken into account, since in many systems these parameters vary on smaller spatial scales than can be accounted for with the model [ ]. A number of studies have addressed spatial scaling issues, primarily in natural or forested systems [ ; ; ; ]. However, to our knowledge, no comparable spatial scaling analysis has been performed for a predominantly agricultural landscape. Inverse, or top‐down, approaches infer surface C exchanges from atmospheric measurements and tend to focus on large spatial scales, from regional [ ; ; ; ; ] to global [ ; ; ; ; ; ; ]. A common thread in these models is the need for land surface models with readily adjustable parameters that can be optimized based on comparison of predicted and measured atmospheric mixing ratios. Because many inverse approaches include consideration of multiple sources of uncertainty [ ], identifying likely uncertainties in the land surface parameterizations for ecosystem fluxes is of significant interest and importance. Remotely sensed estimates of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) have been developed, for example, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite optical and near‐infrared spectral wavelengths [ ; ; ; ; ]. A number of studies have compared MODIS‐based GPP estimates with GPP inferred from eddy covariance measurements, primarily in forested systems and secondarily in grasslands [ ; ; , ; ]. Currently, the methods described above all have shortcomings when applied to estimating C budgets of complex, spatially heterogeneous regions. In fact, even determining whether a particular modeling approach is accurate in such a system is difficult, since one cannot directly monitor the C exchanges across a large region with varying cover types and vegetation status. On the other hand, accurately estimating these C exchanges is critical to improve climate prediction, for climate change attribution, and to account for the costs of fossil fuel CO 2 emissions [ ]. In this study we developed and applied a bottom‐up, distributed, land surface modeling approach in a very heterogeneous region (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility (ACRF)) in the U.S. Southern Great Plains to estimate terrestrial C exchanges at spatial scales consistent with the scale of vegetation heterogeneity. The ACRF comprises about 300 × 400 km in Oklahoma and Kansas, and is very well instrumented for the study of atmospheric radiation, clouds, land surface exchanges, and their interactions. The area is largely agricultural and is spatially and temporally heterogeneous in vegetation cover type and status ( ). Measurements distributed in the facility include a 60 m tower instrumented with eddy covariance systems measuring CO 2 , latent heat (LH), and sensible heat (SH) fluxes at 4, 25, and 60 m; two portable eddy covariance systems; atmospheric and cloud sensing systems; and regular balloon sonde and aircraft measurements. Meteorological forcing data are available from the Kansas and Oklahoma Mesonet sites [ ]. For this analysis, we tested and used a previously described method [ ] to estimate climate forcing from the OK and KS Mesonet data sets. Surface cover type was estimated at 250 m resolution from satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and archetypal annual NDVI profiles and compared to county‐level statistics. We then calibrated and tested a land surface model (ISOLSM [ ]) using eddy covariance data from three of the dominant land use types. We applied these measurements and modeling tools to characterize the region's net surface C (NEE) and energy exchanges with the local atmosphere for three years (2003 – 2005). We note that NEE estimates in agricultural systems do not represent a “true” atmospheric sink, since much of the agricultural product is shipped out of the region, where it may be returned to the atmosphere relatively quickly. Our objectives were to understand how spatial and temporal variability in cover type and status affect regional exchanges and to quantify uncertainty in NEE and latent heat flux estimates resulting from spatial resolution in surface characterization and forcing variable estimates. These three years spanned large variations in the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation, and we therefore expected substantial interannual variability in regional NEE and surface energy exchanges. We also expected that the spatial resolution at which vegetation cover type and status are specified would affect regional NEE and surface energy exchange estimates. Methods Meteorological Forcing We created a spatially and temporally distributed meteorological forcing data set from the Oklahoma and Kansas Mesonet data sets [ ]. The Oklahoma and Kansas Mesonet consists of ∼139 platforms distributed throughout the two states. Stations in and immediately surrounding the ACRF are shown in . Each station measures relative humidity, wind speed, air temperature and pressure, and downward solar radiation, and reports these data as five, thirty, or sixty minute averages. The ARM archive ( [ ]) makes these data available a few days after the measurements are collected. We estimated downward infrared radiation using Boltzman's law, observed air temperature, and estimates of surface and atmospheric emissivity. We distributed the atmospheric forcing data required by ISOLSM to a user‐defined resolution using the approach of . For the results presented below, we use several grid resolutions (i.e., 10, 30, 60, and 90 km) for the interpolated atmospheric forcing. Because of the spacing between Mesonet sites (∼15 km), resolutions finer than about 10 km do not add more information to the interpolated field. We calculated the weighting factors, α i , using: _placeholder_formula_ Here, H ( x ) is the interpolated meteorological field, Q ( x − x i ) is a radial basis function, and x i is the distance to a particular observation point. The basis function is calculated as: _placeholder_formula_ where c is a smoothing parameter (taken as 0.05). Finally, the interpolated meteorological field, H ip , is calculated as: _placeholder_formula_ where Q g and α are matrices formed from Q and α i . After interpolation, we performed checks on the interpolated fields to ensure that all values at all times and spatial points were within reasonable ranges. Hourly precipitation estimates at 4 km resolution were generated using Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) radar precipitation [ ] and rain gauge reports over the Arkansas Red river basin. This data set is available on the ARM archive; we spatially regridded the hourly data to the user‐defined spatial resolution. Estimating Surface Cover Type and LAI From MODIS NDVI To estimate surface cover type and leaf area index (LAI) ( L , m 2 m −2 ) across the ACRF we used the 250 m NDVI ( N (−)) product. Because cover type and LAI vary across the ACRF on 100 m scales, a continuous finer resolution product would be preferable; however, such temporally and spatially resolved observations are currently unavailable. The NDVI product is produced every sixteen days from daily 250 m MODIS red and near infrared surface reflectance data. The composites are based on the maximum NDVI for the compositing period, and the data are provided as an Alber's Conic Equal Area projection. We determine the surface cover type by convolving an archetypal normalized NDVI history, N i , for each vegetation type with the satellite‐derived estimate of NDVI ( N ): _placeholder_formula_ Here, v is the vegetation type (−); Z is the ranking index for each vegetation type (−); and t is time (y). Note that we have normalized the archetypal NDVI histories to ensure that variations and uncertainties in the peak magnitudes of N do not affect the ranking index. The archetypal histories were derived from LAI observations in the ACRF using the method described by , . The vegetation type for each 250 m pixel is determined by the highest value of Z calculated for the full year. This approach did not adequately separate summer C 4 crops from pastures, which are a mixture of C 3 and C 4 grasses. Therefore, at the end of the process, C 4 crop cells with high N in April were set to be pasture because C 4 crops do not typically have appreciable LAI in April. Although crude, this method broadly captured the vegetation distributions seen in the 2002 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census data [ ], as described below. Estimation of LAI from NDVI data can be problematic, particularly for high LAI and clumped vegetation. For this study, we mapped the five dominant vegetation types in the ACRF onto those described by , , and used their approach to infer LAI. Estimating Surface Cover Type From County‐Level Data For comparison to the vegetation type distributions estimated from MODIS NDVI, we estimated fractional cover for each vegetation type from county‐level data contained in the 2002 Census of Agriculture [ ]. This census is taken on a 5 year cycle, with farm data collected in years ending in 2 and 7. The census definition of a farm is any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. The crop production data contained in the Census are collected for many cover types, so we consolidated the data to facilitate comparisons to the cover types simulated by ISOLSM ( ). Because the crop production data are for 2002, and planting of various crop types depends strongly on climatic and economic conditions and can have substantial interannual variability, we do not expect perfect agreement between the NDVI‐ and Census‐derived fractions of land occupied by each cover type. However, agreement between the two methods for relative proportion of each land cover type within the region gave us some confidence that vegetation type is appropriately accounted for in the simulation results. Eddy Covariance Flux Measurements Eddy covariance fluxes were calculated using methods described by and ; we summarize them briefly here. The flux measurements have been made continuously since 2002 in one winter wheat field and for growing seasons up to the present in several additional fields (5 pastures, 4 winter wheat, and 3 sorghum) in the ACRF, with most of the measurements taking place near the Central Facility [ ] ( ). Each system is comprised of a sonic anemometer and an open‐path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA; Li‐COR Li‐7500), a set of meteorological instruments that monitor net and photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and relative humidity, precipitation, soil heat flux, and soil moisture and temperature (for more details, see ). The IRGAs are calibrated before and after each deployment. Fluxes were calculated on half‐hour averages using standard algorithms comprising spike removal, coordinate rotation to zero mean vertical wind, and block averaging of scalar quantities. Density corrections [ ] were applied to the covariances of vertical wind with measured CO 2 and H 2 O densities obtained with the IRGA. Fluxes were calculated by lagging the wind fluctuations in time to maximize the covariance (typical lag < 0.5 s). Multiplicative spectral corrections, caused by sensor separation and other factors [ ], were calculated after confirming that the measured cospectra were consistent with similarity theory. In general, the corrections were small (∼10%), did not introduce systematic biases, were consistent across the different field sites, and hence were not applied to the data. The eddy covariance fluxes were corrected for changes in CO 2 stored below the 4 m measurement height using measured CO 2 concentrations. An examination of subsets of the data showed that the storage corrections are small compared with turbulent fluxes except when friction velocity, u *, is small. From a total of 1732 site days of deployment in 2002–2004, data passed quality control approximately 80% of daytime hours. Losses were mainly due to occasional photovoltaic power systems losses and bad IRGA signals during rain events. Nighttime data were subjected to a quality control on turbulence intensity as judged by friction velocity. Examination of selected data sets showed that nighttime NEE either did not vary significantly with u * or increased to asymptotic values for u * between 0.1 and 0.3 m s −1 . We subjected nighttime data to the constraint that u * > 0.1 m s −1 , which passed 69% of nighttime data. Land Surface Model (ISOLSM) For simulations presented here we used the land surface model ISOLSM [ ; , ; , 2005], which is based on LSM1 [ ]. ISOLSM is a “big‐leaf” [e.g., ; , ] land surface model that simulates CO 2 , H 2 O, and energy fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. ISOLSM simulates aboveground fluxes of radiation, momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat ( L ); vertically explicit energy and water fluxes below ground, and coupled CO 2 and H 2 O exchange between soil, plants, and the atmosphere. Soil hydraulic characteristics are determined from soil sand, silt, and clay content and used in a Richard's equation approach to estimate soil moisture. Soil C effluxes are estimated as the sum of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, with the latter predicted using soil temperature (i.e., Q 10 approach), moisture, and organic C content. The primary enhancements in ISOLSM (as compared to LSM1) relevant to this study include (1) modules that simulate the ecosystem isotopic stocks and exchanges of H 2 18 O, HDO, C 18 OO, and 13 CO 2 ; (2) modification of the gross photosynthesis calculations, as described below; and (3) estimation of LAI and land cover type from satellite data. ISOLSM and LSM1 have been tested in a range of ecosystems at the site level [e.g., , ; ]. The version of ISOLSM applied here differs from that described by by several changes made to the plant physiology submodel. First, low and high temperature inhibition factors on the maximum catalytic capacity of Rubisco ( V m ) from , have been included. Second, we implemented the method of , to smooth transitions between the three limiting assimilation rates (i.e., Rubisco, light, and export limited). Finally, iterations to estimate C c and C i , the leaf chloroplast and internal CO 2 concentrations, respectively, are now performed using net photosynthesis (i.e., accounting for leaf respiration occurring inside the leaf), as opposed to gross photosynthesis, as done in the original version of LSM1. Of these changes, the last had the largest impact, resulting in values for V m and C i that are much closer to measured values. We note, however, that we obtained similar GPP and NEE estimates with the two approaches. Although excluding leaf respiration from the photosynthesis iteration (in our old approach) did not degrade NEE estimates, the unrealistic C i values obtained could be problematic when estimating isotopic fluxes (e.g., 13 CO 2 , C 18 OO). We added or modified five new land surface types to ISOLSM corresponding to the dominant vegetation in the ACRF: summer C 3 crop, winter C 3 crop, summer C 4 crop, pasture (C 3 and C 4 grasses), and broadleaf deciduous forest. We estimated ecosystem parameters for these systems using the Mesonet meteorological forcing data and the eddy covariance measurements described above. ISOLSM was calibrated to the data for these land surface types using an iterative least squares fit for soil carbon content, C s (kg C m −2 ), and the maximum rate of carboxylation, V m ( μ mol m −2 s −1 ). The approach minimized differences between predicted and observed NEE during two periods: nighttime (9 P.M. – 4 A.M.) and daytime (10 A.M. – 2 P.M.). We first estimated C s using nighttime data, since soil heterotrophic respiration continues during the day and must be subtracted from NEE in order to estimate V m . The data available for the parameter generation and test of the resulting simulations are described in . We modeled the pasture as a combination of C 3 and C 4 grasses, with leaf area indices for each type varying differently over the year. We applied the results of to partition the NDVI‐derived LAI into C 3 and C 4 components for each grid cell. They estimated that the C 4 percentage in April, June, July, and September is 38, 47, 50, and 85%, respectively. We used linear interpolation to estimate the C 4 percentage for the remaining months. Several features of cropped systems are not explicitly simulated in ISOLSM, including fertilizer and water application, planting and harvesting, and residue removal. We note that most of the ACRF is rainfed, so that water management should not be a large source of error, and that the observed LAI profiles should give relatively accurate estimates of when crops are planted and harvested. Forcing the model with observed LAI profiles should also somewhat mitigate inaccuracies resulting from the model's inability to predict the effects of fertilizer application on LAI and photosynthesis. Measuring fertilizer application rates, and accurately modeling their effects, at fine spatial scales across the ACRF would be difficult; however, such an effort should be considered in future work. Simulations The ACRF covers about 12,000 km 2 . Therefore simulations at a spatial resolution of 250 m require about 2,000,000 cells to span the region. Simulating multiple years at this resolution across the ACRF was intractable given our computational resources. We devised the following sampling strategy to address this issue for the fine‐resolution (i.e., 250 m) simulations. First, a uniform coarse grid (composed of “macrocells”) was superimposed across the region. For example, about 1200 macrocells measuring 10 × 10 km span the ACRF. Within each macrocell, we simulated up to ten randomly chosen 250 m grid cells (microcells) for each of the six possible vegetation covers present in region. Fewer than ten microcells may be present in a macrocell if a particular vegetation cover type is sparse in that macrocell. Macrocell land surface fluxes for each vegetation cover type were calculated as a mean and standard deviation (SD) of the modeled microcell fluxes. This sampling approach substantially reduced the required simulation time while still providing land surface flux mean and variability estimates from each vegetation cover type. Spatial Scaling Simulations We tested two methods, which have been applied in previous spatial scaling studies, for estimating regional CO 2 and LH fluxes at model resolutions greater than 250 m. The first, and simplest, approach was to perform the simulation with the dominant surface cover (i.e., corresponding to the largest fractional cover) and an average LAI computed from the cell. The second approach used the mean LAI for each surface cover type in the cell and weighted the results by the fractional cover of each cover type. This second method is applied, for example, in the NCAR GCM land surface model CLM [ ]. We tested the accuracy of these approaches in estimating regional NEE and LH fluxes by consolidating climate forcing, LAI, and soil characterization at 10, 30, 60, and 90 km scales. For the climate forcing, the interpolation approach described above was performed at the user‐specified resolution. The predicted regional NEE and LH fluxes using these methods were compared to those calculated at 250 m resolution. Results and Discussion Meteorological Forcing We compared interpolated meteorological fields to measurements from the Mesonet sites (which were used in the interpolation) as well as to several sources not used in the interpolation: ARM Extended Facilities (EF [ ]) observations and eddy covariance tower observations. An example of the climate forcing data calculated using the Mesonet and Extended Facilities data is shown in (surface relative humidity on 22 March 2003 at 0000). The interpolation method accurately reproduced the Mesonet measurements used in the interpolation; independent (not used in the interpolation) eddy covariance measurements over two continuous years in winter wheat and over the growing season in two pastures, three other winter wheat fields, and two sorghum fields (e.g., ); and independent observations from Extended Facilities stations ( ). Typically, annual cumulative precipitation increases from east to west across the ACRF. Annual precipitation differed substantially among the three years (754, 950, and 797 mm in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively), with 2004 being the wettest year. Substantial interannual differences also occurred in the seasonality of precipitation. In heterogeneous systems such as the ACRF, spatial variability in surface energy fluxes can cause heterogeneous near‐surface winds, temperature, and humidity. There is a negative feedback on this climate forcing field heterogeneity, since the resulting increase in mixing will tend to homogenize these fields. This mixing can, to some extent, ameliorate this problem for modeling approaches that do not fully characterize the spatial variability of climate forcing within a computational domain. For this study, because the climate observations we used are spatially dense, our derived climate forcing likely captures the spatial variability actually experienced by individual points on the land surface. Surface Cover Type and LAI We compared our surface cover type predictions to USDA county‐level agricultural census statistics at three scales: (1) county, (2) the four quadrants of the ACRF, and (3) the entire ACRF. In this comparison we included counties with more than 80% agricultural land, corresponding to 70% of the counties. At the ACRF scale, predicted and 2002 Census mean vegetation cover matched well for all the cover types ( ). Specifically, the low fractional cover of summer C 4 crop, intermediate fractions of summer and winter C 3 vegetation and forest, and large fraction of pastures were accurately predicted. Large‐scale spatial patterns in the county‐aggregated predictions of 2002 land cover inferred using MODIS NDVI accurately matched those from the 2002 Census data ( ). In both, there was a substantial difference in fractional coverage between the SE and the other three quadrants. Winter C 3 crop coverage is about 20% in the NW, NE, and SW quadrants, and about 55% in the SE quadrant. In contrast, pasture coverage is about 50–60% in the NW, NE, and SW quadrants and about 30% in the SE quadrant. We note two caveats relevant to this comparison. First, the 2002 Census data only included agricultural land, so a comparison of percent cover of each vegetation type was reasonable only if most of the land in a particular county was agricultural. Second, the comparison is only applicable in 2002, since there was substantial interannual variability in the types of crops planted, although the broad spatial patterns of vegetation cover were relatively stable. For example, 2003 had a relatively higher prevalence of winter C 3 crops and relatively lower prevalence of pasture. We discuss below the relationship between precipitation anomalies and fractional cover of the various crops. Parameter Calibration We calibrated V m and S c using the eddy covariance measurements; best fit parameters are shown in and simulations using these best fit parameters are shown in . These values are within the range of expected values for the various vegetation types [ , ]. We note that improvements to these parameter estimations could be made if more eddy covariance measurements were available. Overall, ISOLSM accurately simulated net ecosystem C exchange in these systems where observations were available for testing. Soil Moisture Soil moisture exerts a strong control on heterotrophic respiration, plant drought stress, surface evaporative fluxes, and other surface processes. On weekly to monthly time scales, interannual differences in near‐surface (0–30 cm) soil moisture were temporally complex and not obviously related to annual precipitation. Soils in summer 2004 were consistently wetter than in summer 2003 in all vegetation cover types. However, soils were wetter in 2003 and 2005 (compared to 2004) in September in all vegetation cover types. There were no substantial early September rains in 2004, but there were October and November rains that caused soil moisture to be wetter than in either 2003 or 2005. Regional NEE Estimates We first present predictions from the 250 m simulations in the U.S. Southern Great Plains, which were computed as vegetation‐cover‐weighted averages of ten 250 m cells per 10 km macro‐cell. We then compare these results to those obtained with simulations at coarser spatial scales and two scaling methods. We calculated that the ACRF‐SGP region was a net C sink, relative to the local atmospheric, for the three years simulated ( ). Cumulative annual NEE was predicted to be −240, −340, and −270 g C m −2 yr −1 for 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively (implying an average annual net atmospheric C sink of about 2.8 t C ha −1 ). Again, these estimates do not represent a “true” sink, since some of the agricultural product is shipped out of the region, where it may be returned to the atmosphere relatively quickly. Predicted spatial variability in midday NEE was large (e.g., shows midday NEE on 15 April 2003). At this time, C uptake was larger in the north‐to‐south band in the center of the ACRF, consistent with winter wheat being near its peak LAI in this area. Further, cloud cover resulted in relatively larger solar radiation over the winter wheat belt, further enhancing the large‐scale NEE spatial pattern. Midday NEE spatial heterogeneity within each 10 km macrocell (indicated by the fractional‐cover‐weighted standard deviation of the 250 m simulations) was often as large as 75% of the mean and larger than the mean in about one‐quarter of the macrocells ( ). This fine‐scale variability resulted from large differences in LAI among the ten (for each vegetation cover type) 250 m grid cells in each 10 km macrocell. Spatial heterogeneity in nighttime NEE, which is comprised solely of ecosystem respiration, was much smaller than that of daytime NEE. Interannual variability in regional‐average NEE was substantial and resulted from several factors, including interannual variability in climate, fractional cover of vegetation types, and LAI for each cover type. For example, comparing 2003 and 2004, the difference in cumulative‐annual NEE was partially caused by larger C uptake between March and May in 2004. This larger C uptake was driven by larger LAI in C 3 winter crop (∼1 m 2 m −2 larger in 2004 than in 2003) and pasture (∼0.5 m 2 m −2 larger) during this period. We note that 2004 was also the year with the highest cumulative precipitation, which may be responsible for the larger LAI. Also, air temperatures were higher during this period in 2003 than in 2004, leading to larger predicted soil respiration and therefore lower net ecosystem C uptake. Finally, there was also a large change in vegetation cover between 2003 and 2004 in which fractional cover of pasture increased from about 40 to 65% and C 3 winter crops decreased from about 31 to 20%. Regional net C uptake was smaller in 2005 than 2004, with uptake by both C 3 winter crops and pasture contributing to this difference. The fractional cover of each vegetation type was relatively constant between 2004 and 2005. However, the LAI of C 3 winter crops was lower during the peak uptake period of March–May in 2005 than in 2004, as was LAI for pasture between April and June. Regional‐mean pasture LAI in July and August 2005 was larger than it was in 2004; however, warmer temperatures during July and August in 2005 drove increased soil respiration C fluxes during this period. Our calculations of NEE take into account the influence of a number of biophysical variables, such as cover type, LAI, precipitation, and temperature. We did not consider some other factors that can influence NEE, as described above, such as fertilizer type and application rate [ ]. In addition, we did not predict land use or land cover, but rather simulated NEE given land cover patterns. Predictions of future ecosystem fluxes in managed landscapes will have to use some method of predicting land cover and land management, which are functions of many factors, including farmers' decisions of what and when to plant and of economic forces (e.g., labor and fertilizer costs, crop subsidies). For example, recent demand and government incentives for biofuel crops (i.e., corn) are driving increases in corn production in many of the Great Plains states [ ]. Regional Latent Heat Fluxes and Water Use Efficiency Spatial heterogeneity in LH fluxes was smaller than it was in NEE, although broad spatial patterns in the two fluxes were consistent (compare , which show NEE and LH for noon on 15 April 2003). As described above for NEE, the pattern at this point in time is consistent with the active winter wheat and solar radiation distributions. Spatial heterogeneity in midday LH (calculated as for NEE above) was usually less than 10% of the mean in each 10 km macrocell. Interannual differences in predicted weekly LH fluxes were smaller than for NEE. Variation in weekly LH fluxes was smallest in 2004, the year with the most precipitation. Consistent with stomatal control of CO 2 assimilation and transpiration [e.g., ], daytime, weekly, regional latent heat flux ( L ) predicted at the 250 m scale was correlated with GPP ( ; R 2 = 0.7; note that only weeks with L > 50 W m −2 are included). The slope of the line for predicted cumulative GPP versus cumulative L , a measure of water use efficiency (WUE, g C kg −1 H 2 O), was relatively consistent among years; the average annual WUE for all three years for the region was 3.4 g C kg −1 H 2 O. This value is consistent with those found by in their analysis of FLUXNET data, who reported slopes of 3.4, 3.2, and 3.1 g C kg −1 H 2 O for grasslands, deciduous broadleaf forests, and crops, respectively. also tested whether a vapor pressure deficit weighted WUE (WUE‐VPD; calculated as g C assimilated per kg H 2 O lost multiplied by vapor pressure deficit) correlated with GPP, and found poorer correlation, although this metric has been applied to estimate large‐scale C exchanges [ ]. Consistent with the FLUXNET analysis [ ], we found a poorer correlation (R 2 = 0.5) between WUE‐VPD and GPP. Effect of Spatial Resolution on Regional Predictions To determine how the spatial resolution of simulations affected predictions of surface fluxes in a region with fine‐scale spatial heterogeneity, we performed two series of model runs at 10, 30, 60, and 90 km resolutions. First, we applied a single dominant vegetation cover type and average LAI in each grid cell to calculate the NEE and LH values for each cell. Second, we applied the mean LAI of each cover type in each grid cell to estimate each cover type's surface exchanges, and then weighted these estimates by the fractional cover within the cell to calculate NEE and LH for each grid cell. The resulting regional fluxes were then compared to predictions at 250 m resolution. Predicted annual cumulative regional NEE in 2003 using the dominant cover approach was −280, −370, −400, and −340 g C m −2 yr −1 at 10, 30, 60, and 90 km, respectively, and in 2004 was −390, −410, −410, and −410 g C m −2 yr −1 for the same set of spatial resolutions ( ). Maximum biases compared to the cumulative annual regional NEE calculated at the 250 m scale were 70% and 20% in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Biases of over 100% occurred in both years for weekly integrated NEE; the fractional bias was largest in winter when NEE is typically small. In both years, the regional average assimilation was higher when predicted at the coarser scales than at the 250 m scale. This bias resulted from a combination of the increasing dominance of pasture over C 3 winter crop as scale increased and the larger C assimilation by pasture. The effect was stronger in 2004 because more than 90% of the surface was characterized as pasture at the 90 km scale. The second approach (which is used in many current land surface models) led to regional annual estimates of up to 25% more net C uptake than the 250 m simulations in 2003 ( ) and 2004 ( ). Weekly biases, between 10 and 50% during the growing season, were also smaller than for the dominant cover scaling. At all scales, weekly biases in predicted assimilation and ecosystem respiration were smaller (∼10%) than for NEE, but when combined to predict NEE led to larger fractional biases than for either flux alone. Simulations at coarser resolutions consistently predicted more C uptake than those at the 250 m scale. This bias resulted primarily from using the mean of the 250 m LAI values, even though the LAI had a distribution that was consistently more lognormal than symmetric, for each cover type across the larger grid cell ( ). We note also that, even for a symmetric LAI distribution, a single NEE calculated using the mean LAI may differ from a mean NEE calculated across the LAI distribution. Such a discrepancy can occur because canopy assimilation is, in general, nonlinearly related to LAI due to the changing proportion of leaves in shaded and sunlit conditions, leaf clumping, and other factors [ ]. Thus, achieving accurate NEE estimates with simulation resolutions that are much coarser than the spatial heterogeneity in cover type and LAI requires a more sophisticated sampling approach than simply using the mean LAI for each cover type in the grid cell. An example approach would be to characterize the LAI probability density function (pdf) of each grid cell by a geometric mean and geometric standard deviation, and then evenly distribute a subset of 250 m grid cell simulations across the LAI range. The grid cell NEE for each cover type would be calculated using the pdf to weight the predictions across the grid cell. Finally, the overall NEE across the grid cell would be calculated by weighting the NEE from each cover type by its fractional cover within the grid cell. The effect of spatial resolution on regional weekly average LH fluxes was smaller than it was for NEE ( ), but somewhat larger than for either assimilation or respiration. The largest summer and winter biases were ∼30 and 20%, respectively. Similar to NEE, the second approach to scaling LH (i.e., weighting by fractional cover predictions in each grid cell that used the mean LAI of each cover type) had lower biases than using the dominant vegetation cover (not shown). There were substantial spatial gradients in weekly LH fluxes across the ACRF that were missed by the coarse‐scale simulation. During midday, for example, LH spatial gradients across the region of hundreds of W m −2 are common ( ). Similarly, temporal averaging obscured important diurnal variations. These variations are caused by both slowly (e.g., LAI) and rapidly (e.g., clouds) varying system characteristics. Therefore, for applications that require accurate characterization of the surface energy budget at diurnal or subdiurnal time scales or 10–100 km spatial scales (e.g., cloud models), including details of variability in climate forcing, cover type, and LAI is required. A number of studies have examined the impacts of spatial heterogeneity on predicted surface fluxes in nonagricultural systems. studied the effect of spatial heterogeneity on surface LH and SH fluxes in southern Arizona using Landsat images and a model based on measured radiometric surface temperature and vegetation cover fraction. They concluded that LH and SH were well estimated using 30 m and 120 m estimates (which were at or below the scale of local vegetation heterogeneity), but the accuracy deteriorated for lower resolution, particularly for LH fluxes. studied spatial scaling issues (with land cover characteristics specified from 30 m to 50 km) within the boreal forest of the BOREAS project [ ]. Compared to the high‐resolution results, they concluded that predictions at the coarser scales resulted in large monthly NPP biases (28 to 48%), but that annual NPP biases were lower (2 to 14%), primarily because of offsetting errors. They also reported lower monthly LH bias (<5%) as compared to NPP biases, again due to partial compensation of model errors. Our results showed similar patterns: i.e., predicted annual NEE biases were smaller than many of the weekly average biases, and predicted weekly biases in LH were smaller than for NEE. showed, with a land surface model applied across Canada, that differences of up to 25% in surface fluxes were predicted with a dominant cover and a fractionally distributed vegetation cover, indicating that different methods of treating subgrid heterogeneities could lead to biases in surface fluxes. For comparison, our simulations had annual cumulative NEE differences between the dominant and fractionally distributed cases as large as 40%, with an average difference of 10%. , in a Pacific Northwest forest, used Landsat 25 m data to study land cover classification and predicted C exchanges across scales up to 1 km. At resolutions coarser than 250 m the pattern of clear‐cuts was lost and the land cover classification agreement at the coarsest scale was relatively poor. Predicted NPP and tree biomass decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing scale. Our estimates of bias associated with the spatial resolution at which agricultural land cover type and status are specified are comparable to those found in these forest studies, as is our observation that LH estimates were somewhat less sensitive to resolution than NEE estimates. We also note that biases in predicted surface fluxes depend on the extent to which the flux of interest depends on land cover type, status, and management. Other trace gases of agricultural interest, such as N 2 O and CH 4 , also depend strongly on these system properties, and therefore we also expect them to vary strongly across spatial scales of system characterization. As mentioned above, inverse methods are being used to estimate regional C and energy exchanges. The first phase of the ongoing NACP Mid‐Continent Intensive (MCI) study ( ) (“interim synthesis”) includes compilation and comparison of top‐down and bottom‐up estimates for a region in the Central U.S. For comparison to our results, we extracted results at 1° × 1° resolution from inversion models (CarbonTracker [ ], UT [ ], LSCE [ ], and CSU [ ]) that spanned at least one year of the three year period of our study. We note that other groups are preparing results for the interim synthesis, but those results were unavailable at the time this paper was finalized. For comparison to the bottom‐up predictions, we averaged the inversion predictions to a 3° × 3° region centered on the ACRF ( ). The inversions are global in scale, with different spatial resolutions, constraining observations, inversion approaches, and downscaling methods; these differences are reflected in the relatively large range of NEE estimates. Given uncertainties in both the inversion and our bottom‐up estimates, it is currently impossible to rank one NEE estimate as superior to the other. However, comparisons between the approaches can highlight periods, system properties, or regions for further study and model improvement. For this study, we note that the late spring peak NEE drawdowns were comparable between the bottom‐up and LSCE inversion predictions, and that net C release during the winter was comparable between the bottom‐up and CarbonTracker predictions. For 2004, the CSU model and bottom‐up approach predicted similar seasonal cycles, but somewhat different peak values in summer. Both the UT and LSCE inversions predicted a large net ecosystem C efflux during summer, which was not predicted in either the CarbonTracker, CSU, or our bottom‐up approach. Further analyses could focus on these differences to improve both the bottom‐up and top‐down regional C exchange estimates of the region. Conclusions We presented bottom‐up C and latent heat exchange predictions in a spatially heterogeneous agricultural region in the Southern Great Plains (ACRF‐SGP). The region was predicted to be a net C sink, with respect to the local atmosphere, of −240, −340, and −270 g C m −2 yr −1 for 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. We note that, in contrast to many forested systems, much of the accumulated biomass represented in this sink may be transported horizontally where it can be rapidly returned to the atmosphere. Both NEE and latent heat fluxes were spatially and temporally heterogeneous, arguing that accurate representation of surface exchanges in this system must account for observed heterogeneity in cover type and vegetation status. Conducting simulations at coarser resolution led to biases in the predicted net ecosystem fluxes, with the magnitude of bias depending on the scaling approach. We predicted differences up to 25% in annual C exchange estimates between the 250 m approach and those based on fractional cover and means of LAI (in 10, 30, 60, and 90 km grid cells) for each cover type. This scaling approach, used in current land surface models, resulted in errors this large (and larger for weekly averages) because of the heterogeneous LAI distribution within land cover types. However, even a symmetric LAI distribution does not guarantee that NEE calculated using the mean LAI will be the same as the cumulative NEE calculated across the LAI distribution. Predicted latent heat flux biases across scales were smaller than those for C exchanges, but somewhat larger than biases for gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Not surprisingly, using a single dominant vegetation cover for each grid cell resulted in even larger biases in surface exchanges. Coarse spatial and temporal resolution simulations also obscured important variations across the region. Our results suggest several steps to improve regional‐scale, bottom‐up, ecosystem C exchange predictions. First, although using observed LAI had the advantage of capturing year‐to‐year variation in cover type and management effects, variations in fertilizer application rate and type, irrigation practices, and planting methods also affect C exchanges [ ] and need to be included in a robust modeling framework. Using observed LAI also precludes predictions of future system behavior. Second, our approach to characterizing vegetation type could be improved with more observations of cover type and LAI in the region. These measurements need to be made at the scale at which cover type varies, i.e., on the order of a hundred meters. Finally, independent methods of estimating regional‐scale fluxes need to be made and compared with bottom‐up estimates. For example, the top‐down approaches described above, as well as boundary layer budgeting approaches [ ; ; ; ; ], show promise in this regard. A combination of approaches will likely be required to establish confidence in regional NEE estimates in heterogeneous landscapes such as the one studied here.

In general, because of the different time response of small and large watersheds, it is very rare that a precipitation event contains the intensity‐duration requirements to activate rivers characterized by very different discharge statistics. Concentrated mesoscale events can produce flash floods on small rivers. The exceptionally of the 2002 consists in the fact that flash flooding was first produced on small rivers in Austria, Bohemia, and the Erz Mountains, followed by record‐breaking floods in larger rivers: the Vltava, Elbe, and parts of the Danube catchments [ ]. These floods caused 36 deaths and over 15 billion USD damage [ ]. Intense summer precipitations, whether or not they cause river floods, are frequent in central Europe and are associated with a track of cyclones known as ‘Vb‐track’. According to , the increase in the number of days with extreme precipitation in summer, observed in the long term time series from the Hohenpeissenberg Observatory station in southern Germany (1881–2001), is related to the more frequent occurrence of weather types associated with Vb‐tracks. Simulated future scenarios for CO 2 ‐induced climate change show a decrease in total summer rainfall in central Europe and an increase in heavy precipitation events, due to a warmer atmosphere (which can carry more water vapor) and/or an increase in the frequency of this type of cyclone tracks [ ; ]. During the August 11–13, 2002 rainfall episode in central Europe, showed that back‐trajectory analysis point to the Western Mediterranean Basin (WMB) as the main vapor source. Similar conclusions were reported by , but only for the initial stages of the rainfall events. have drawn attention to a water vapor accumulation excess over the WMB in recent years due to land use changes and increased air pollution; this excess could also explain the observed increase in torrential rains. If the hydrological cycle of the Mediterranean region is being perturbed, it is of key importance to identify the water‐vapor evaporation areas responsible for the extreme events and to determine the capacity of the region to recycle its precipitation. In this respect, the HyMeX international program (HYdrological cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment), launched in 2006 and endorsed by the WMO's two major international programs dealing with weather prediction and climate research (WCRP‐THORPEX and WWRP‐GEWEX), has focused on understanding the water cycle in this region, with emphasis on high‐impact weather events, inter‐annual to decadal variability and associated trends in the context of global change. The results should help us to identify both the perturbations of the water cycle in a system with important feedbacks between oceanic, atmospheric, and hydrological processes, and the corrections needed to avoid or reduce extreme rainfall and its consequences. has demonstrated that the WMB, an important evaporation source during the August 2002 episode, behaves like a holding tank during summer: the vapor, together with pollutants, can accumulate for several days in a quasi‐closed horizontal circulation, which results in a vertical pile‐up of accumulation layers after coastal convergence, followed by return flows into the basin after divergence over the top of the coastal mountains. Vapor and pollution accumulation will continue for several days until a disturbance vents them off, ahead of the frontal system entering the area. Morning‐to‐evening cycles are inhibited before a new cycle of accumulation starts over the WMB. A similar process occurs in northern Africa around the Atlas Mountains [ ]: the convergence that takes place at the N‐African thermal low will accumulate in the N‐African mid‐troposphere the pollutants and water vapor available at the Atlantic and Mediterranean marine boundary layers (MBLs). In addition, we showed that soil dust also accumulates in these layers [ ], which are mainly fed by daytime upslope flows in the southern flanks. These reservoir layers can move around the Atlas Mountains following the induced circulation of the N‐African anticyclone. The moisture advection associated with transiting cyclones and fronts across the WMB, with a typical recurring time of about 3–10 days [ ], can be increased by the above mechanism, if the cyclone phase and the proper dynamical forcing are simultaneously present. Therefore, the formation of moisture reservoirs could increase the likelihood of anomalous precipitation. This study aims at clarifying the role played by reservoir layers over the WMB in the extreme precipitation events of the 11–13 August 2002. Other marine evaporative sources like the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean will also be investigated in order to clarify their contribution. We will need to track air masses with trajectories ending at a selected target area during the intense precipitation period (August 11–13, 2002) using a methodology that guarantees an accurate estimation of winds and stability at high resolution in an area of complex terrain like southern and central Europe. In this respect, the manuscript is organized as follows: the synoptic scenario during the precipitation episode in central Europe is described in . is devoted to the mesoscale simulation and its validation. The air mass tracing and the sequence of events during the episode is shown in , as well as the discussion on the origin of the different air masses converging over the target area. Finally, in we summarize the main results. In a subsequent companion paper [ ] we describe a new method developed by our group at the University of the Basque Country and the Fundación CEAM for identifying moisture source regions and quantifying their respective contribution to a selected target precipitation: the rainfall episode of August 11–13 is used for this application. The Precipitation Episode: Synoptic Scenario During the first two weeks of August 2002, tracks of midlatitude lows were shifted south of their average location for this time of the year in southern Europe [ ]. During nighttime from August 5 to 6, a low formed between the Gulf of Genoa and the Alps. It moved eastward across northern Italy and the Adriatic Sea toward the Western Balkans, out of the WMB, leaving important rainfalls in central Europe on August 6–7 [ ]. On the following days, normal conditions over the WMB, with relative high pressures from August 6 to 9, favored coastal convergence and sea‐breezes with the corresponding accumulation of pollutants (and moisture), as described by , , ] and , ]. The accumulation mode ceased abruptly during the passage of a new disturbance: the cyclone Ilse , located over southern England on August 9, intensified over the Gulf of Genoa on August 10. The cyclone inhibited the coastal convergence of sea‐breezes and the compensatory subsidence over the western basin, and forced intense southwesterlies into the region. This resulted in warm and moist air advection at lower levels, which crossed the Italian peninsula, the Adriatic Sea and the western Balkans into central Europe, along a cyclonically curved path. During August 10 and until 0000 UTC on August 11, the track of the surface low Ilse moved slowly across northern Italy into the Adriatic Sea [ ]. At upper levels, the 200 hPa flow showed a trough in the jet stream associated with the formation of Ilse on August 9 (not shown). On the next day, the trough moved southward and intensified first over the Gulf of Lyon and then over the Gulf of Genoa during August 11, showing a very tight short wave at 1200 UTC ( ) with a 50 ms −1 jet streak, unusual for the summer: the upper level divergence produced over central Europe is depicted in the same panel (white dashed line), which shows a large area of negative pressure vertical velocities (ascending air). also shows the 500 hPa geopotential height and relative vorticity, the 850 hPa winds, temperature and moisture, and the sea level pressure with the 1000–500 hPa thickness. The area with the lowest surface pressures in central Europe corresponds to the upper level divergence and air ascending in the whole depth of the troposphere ( ). The tracing of air masses, which will be discussed in after the mesoscale simulation, will show that the warm air located over the western and central Mediterranean before August 10 was running ahead of the trough in a highly curved trajectory on August 11 (temperatures above 12–14°C in and thickness above 564 dam in ). The region between latitudes 45–50 N, located to the north of the vorticity maxima, shows ascending air with high relative humidity ( ): it corresponds to the region of extreme precipitation, and it is located at the boundary between the cold north‐Atlantic advection to the south and the warmer Mediterranean air to the north. In the early morning of August 12 the surface trough reached its lowest pressure over central Europe (the Czech Republic), after turning northward from the Adriatic Sea, and started to leave the area, advancing eastward fairly slowly. The target area, which received the highest precipitation amounts during the August 11–13 episode, was finally a vast region comprised between 45 and 53 N latitude and 8–16 E longitude; it will be marked with a square in the tracing experiments performed in . High‐Resolution Simulations and Mesoscale Model Validation The combined application of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) [ ] and the HYbrid PArticle Concentration and Transport model (HYPACT) [ ], and an adequate selection of domains/resolutions have allowed us to explain episodes of long‐range transport of ozone in northern Iberia and the WMB [ , ], and the mechanism for the accumulation and transport of Saharan soil dust and pollution from southern Europe to the tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean [ ]. Using this methodology, tracks from continuous emissions of selected sources can be used to detect preferred pathways, travel time(s), accumulation layers and the convergence and venting mechanisms of these air masses. A similar method is applied here, using the most recent version of the modeling system RAMS (v6.0) and HYPACT (v1.5) along with new domain coverage and resolutions to cope with the objective of adequately simulating the transport of vapor from source areas into the target area. A good representation of the precipitation over the region and a good synchronism of events between observations and simulations are required to be confident with the HYPACT results, which will simulate trajectories for several days. The topography and coverage of the four selected domains (two‐way nested grids) of the RAMS‐HYPACT modeling system are presented in . Grid #4 is approximately coincident with the precipitation target area, and it has a resolution of 9 km. Intermediate grids #2 and #3 have a resolution of 27 km, and the lowest resolution (108 km) corresponds to grid #1. The vertical coverage of all grids is 22 km, with maximum resolution at lower levels (30 m) decreasing to a minimum of 1000 m above the 11 km height. Four‐dimensional data assimilation was used for the model run, with Newtonian relaxation toward the 6‐hourly NCEP reanalysis data [ ]: a variable relaxation time was used, with the highest values (weak nudging) at the center of the large domain (grid #1) and lowest values (strong nudging) at the boundaries. The run of the mesoscale model performed continuously, from July 27 through August 16, 2002. The topography and land cover were interpolated from the USGS global 30″ database [ ; ]. Weekly averages of the sea surface temperature (SST) data, with a resolution of 1° × 1°, were interpolated from the NCEP Reynolds SST data set [ ]. As the model run extended for more than one week, SST values were interpolated in time during the model run. Our setup included a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy (level 2.5) parameterization [ ], with modifications for a case of growing turbulence [ ], and a full‐column two‐stream parameterization that accounts for each form of condensate (7 species) for the calculations of the radiative transfer [ ]. The cloud and precipitation scheme by was applied in all the domains with all the species activated, and the LEAF‐3 soil vegetation scheme was used to calculate sensible and latent heat flux exchanges with the atmosphere, using prognostic equations for soil moisture and temperature [ ]. After the mesoscale meteorology simulation, hourly wind and turbulence fields obtained by RAMS were fed to the HYPACT model to track the water vapor from a selection of sources. shows the position of the tracer sources, comprising a total of 22 vertical emission line sources, from surface level to 500 m height, placed at the main entrances of marine water vapor to continental areas: WMB (M1 to M8), the Atlantic Ocean (A1 to A10) and the Black Sea together with the Aegean Sea (B1 to B4). The 5 marked regions in are used to show their respective contribution as ‘area sources’ by adding the tracer particles emitted from them. Consequently, only air masses with an initial marine origin are tracked and the role of the terrestrial evaporative sources is discussed in the second part of this paper [ ]. A total of 85200 particles per source were released continuously from July 27 to August 14, and particle locations were tracked for the whole period of simulation (20 days) without being removed by any other mechanism but the venting out of the largest domain boundaries of grid 1 in . The described setup of the modeling system was chosen after having discarded other alternatives, with a different number of grids, domain coverage, resolution, and type of nudging. After every trial, we validated the RAMS meteorological output with NCEP data, wind and temperature profiles from the European NMC stations, output from wind profiler radars (WPR) in Bilbao and Basel, surface precipitation at the target area, MODIS total precipitable water vapor, and precipitation data from the TRMM MultiSatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA). Results shown here were found to be the best representation of the mentioned set of observations. The hourly wind speed and direction calculated by the model and the experimental measurements from two radiosonde stations and two WPRs are represented in and . These are located near the Atlantic and Mediterranean moisture sources (Bilbao and Murcia) and inside the target rainfall area (Basel and Meiningen). The simulated and observed wind profiles agree satisfactorily: the high‐resolution simulation was able to capture both the intensity and the timing of the coastal sea‐breezes and drainage winds recorded in Murcia and the suppression of these mesoscale flow regimens coincident with the passage of Ilse on August 10–11 (marked with a gray square), as well as the change from southerly to northwesterly winds observed in Meiningen on August 12 (indicated with a gray line). The same can be concluded from the comparison of the modeled wind profiles with the WPR outputs at Bilbao and Basel ( ). The statistical values (BIAS, RMSVE, RMSE and correlation, defined by , summarized in , confirm the good agreement between experimental measurements and simulations: despite a slight general underestimation, our RAMS set‐up was able to simulate wind profiles with statistical scores comparable to those of other similar studies [ ; ]. Precipitation totals during the episode (August 11–13) are shown in : the distribution of the simulated precipitation (left panel) and the surface station data (right), as depicted by , cover a similar region with an identical maxima‐minima distribution. Regions with maxima above 180 mm are observed in both panels of as well as in the TMPA data (not shown). Outside of this region, with lower grid‐cell resolutions, the precipitation was underestimated by RAMS, while the coverage of the areas with precipitation was well estimated. As a consequence, it seems that we need at least a grid‐cell resolution similar to that used in grid #4 to obtain an accurate precipitation estimate in all regions. Evolution of the water vapor total column is represented in for August 9 to 12, as shown by MODIS‐TERRA IR images (left panels) and RAMS model simulations (right panels). MODIS images have a resolution of 1 × 1 degree and areas covered by clouds (in white color) contain no vapor data. Venting of the vapor over the Mediterranean to the E and NE, ahead of the disturbance, is synchronous in both sets of panels. The main differences in vapor totals are concentrated in the lower left corner of the figures, at the SW boundary of grid #1, where vapor from the African Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) breaks out into the Atlantic. Above latitude 25 N and over the landmass of northern Africa most of the vapor is accumulated in the middle troposphere (700–300 hPa), which is really an outstanding feature: (left) shows this important concentration of water vapor observed by MODIS. When compared with the total column in the top panel of (color scale is kept constant in both figures), it can be observed that practically all the vapor in N‐Africa is at that height range (700–300 hPa), and that its column, at regions with high values (1.5–2.0 cm), is close to one half of the total column maxima found over the Mediterranean Sea (4.0–5.0 cm in , left). Thus, the water vapor mixing ratio over the northern Africa landmass shows an anomalous vertical distribution, with the lowest values at the surface, increasing with height, and the highest values in the middle troposphere. This anomalous pattern is the result of the same meteorological mechanism responsible for the accumulation of dust around the Atlas Mountains: for water vapor, it applies to the convergence and recirculation of moisture vented to the middle troposphere by the combined upslope flows and coastal sea‐breezes around the Atlas Mountains, as described in . Because the mesoscale model has demonstrated its ability to successfully simulate the observed winds, transport of moisture and precipitation in the target region of central Europe, we will now merge the modeled data and the observations in to show the accumulation processes around the Atlas Mountains and over the WMB during the period August 6–9: (top) and (top) depict the moisture and winds on August 6, while (bottom) and (bottom) show the same data for August 9. August 6 corresponds to the initiation of the WMB accumulation mode after the passage of cyclones over the area. It should be mentioned that, at the same time (August 6–7), large areas of central Europe, northern Italy, and the Western Balkans recorded torrential rains, which contributed to significantly raise water levels in several small rivers of Lower Austria, and also to raise soil saturation levels in the catchment areas of both the Elbe and Danube rivers ( ). In contrast, August 9 corresponds to the ending of the accumulation mode. During this 4‐day period, the coastal convergence (sea breezes‐upslope flows) and sinking over the WMB accumulated vapor over the reservoir layers of the basin, following the aforementioned scheme by , while convergence around the Atlas Mountains fed the middle troposphere reservoir over northern Africa. The mechanisms behind this accumulation are illustrated in the vertical cross sections of the simulated water vapor mixing ratio (shaded colors) and the cross wind components (u‐w and v‐w streamlines) at a constant latitude 38 N ( , left) and at a constant longitude 0 ( , right) during these two days (August 6 and 9, 12 UTC). The cross sections show the deep vertical injections that take place both over eastern Iberia (3000 m) and over northern Africa (>5000 m) as a result of the combined sea‐breeze and upslope daytime convergence over the coastal range of mountains. These injections, and their return flows back over the sea, lead to the vertical recirculation of the water vapor and to its accumulation over the WMB (see changes in the water column from (top middle) to (bottom middle), as well as from (top left) to (bottom left) and (top right) to (bottom right)), while another fraction is transported within the anticyclonic gyre of the N‐African mid‐tropospheric circulation. The layer containing more than 4 g/kg of water vapor extends up to 3000–4000 m over eastern Iberia and northern Africa on August 9. On August 10 ( ), the effects of the passage of the Atlantic cyclone Ilse over the WMB are clearly observed: the sea‐breeze convergence over the crest of the mountains is inhibited, and the frontal system vents off the water vapor into central and eastern Europe, reducing the total column of water vapor over the western Mediterranean from 3.75 to 4.0 to 1.75 cm in less than 12 h. Tracing of Air Masses and Discussion Two issues must now be addressed: the source of the water vapor responsible for the central Europe precipitation events on August 11–13, and the role of the WMB and N‐African vapor accumulation layers in the precipitation on the target area. On August 9, 2002, the accumulation period over the WMB, initiated on August 6 after the massive intrusion of an air mass of N‐Atlantic origin through southern France and the Gulf of Lyon, entered its last day. This period is observed in and , at the coastal station of the WMB (Murcia), between the initiation and finishing of the easterlies regime (sea‐breeze regimes at eastern Iberia) flowing at lower levels and decoupled from the westerlies blowing on top. The frontal irruption is always followed by intense northerlies (colored in red in the figure), which blow after a short period of southerlies (colored in green). Notice that this systematic decoupling is not observed in the Meiningen station. The left panels in show the track of the tracer emitted in the N‐Atlantic region (total burden of tracer particles), while the right panels show the age of the tracked particles (each color corresponds to a time lapse of 24 h). August 9 and 10 (1200 UTC) correspond to the end of the accumulation period over the WMB and the initiation of the transport into central Europe under the perturbed conditions created in the region by cyclone Ilse . Arrows show the wind transporting the main fraction of the tracer: on the upper‐left panel they show the main paths into the Mediterranean. Once inside the basin, the western branch follows the combined upslope flows and coastal sea‐breezes of eastern Iberia and northern Africa during the accumulation period of August 6 to 9, while the eastern branch drifts slowly southward, parallel to the Italian Peninsula, from August 7 to 9. Following our simulations, the main fraction of the tracer was transported over the Mediterranean Sea in the lower troposphere (0–2000 m). For the lower 1000 m, the water vapor entered the Mediterranean with an average mixing ratio of 8.5 g/kg and exited with 12.5 g/kg, after being transported (following the irruption of Vb cyclone Ilse ) through the Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea. Then, it crossed the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe into the target area during August 10 ( , bottom): red arrows indicate that the N‐Atlantic tracer was vented to the middle and upper troposphere. The low level flow forced by the Scandinavian Anticyclone, ahead of the disturbance, is marked with a white arrow in . Similar tracks are observed for the tracer emitted from the Bay of Biscay and from the WMB itself (not shown). The massive intrusion into the WMB for the tracer released at the Bay of Biscay also occurred on August 6 through the Gulf of Lyon. A smaller fraction crossed Iberia over the Ebro Valley into the WMB. The main differences with the N‐Atlantic tracer are related to the time of arrival at the target area on August 11. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the main fraction of the joint tracer released from all these sources (marked in red in ) was vented to the middle and upper troposphere (0–8000m) before arriving at the latitudes of the target area: shows a detail of the venting of the N‐Atlantic tracer over the Western Balkans at 00 UTC and 12 UTC on August 10. The figure also shows the topography of the region as well as a plan view and vertical cross‐section of the tracer distribution. The joint air masses warmed and moistened in the WMB entrained additional water from evapo‐transpiration over the Western Balkans, increasing their mixing ratio before arriving at the target area on August 11. However, our mesoscale model results show that the precipitation during the trajectory over the Balkans would probably have compensated the evapo‐transpiration, since the water vapor total column remained constant within the air mass (4 cm), and the average vapor mixing ratio of the lower 1000 m kept at the same values as when leaving the Adriatic Sea (12.5 g/kg). shows the time‐sequence of the daily evaporation (accumulated during each 24 h) attributed to the initial precipitation (0000–1200 UTC, August 11) in a southern subset of the target rainfall area (named SR in the companion paper), which includes Upper Austria and southeastern Germany. The heavy rain started and ended somewhat earlier in this region than in the north and northeast (named NR). Most of the observed evaporation areas, estimated by the new methodology presented in the companion paper, follow the surface trajectories of the winds transporting the air mass entering the WMB during the accumulation period. Since the main fraction of the attribution occurs during the 6‐to‐8 days preceding the precipitation event, as is shown in the companion paper, the represents main moisture sources during the initiation of the event in the southern region of the target rainfall area. The evaporation at the eastern and western branches of the air masses entering the WMB is observed in the figure from August 6 to 9, while on August 10, the evaporation is centered inside the trajectories approaching the target, including the Adriatic Sea and the western Balkans. (top left) shows how the tracer entered the target area on August 11, after crossing the Balkans and Eastern Europe and veering to the West pointing to the low pressure region developed at the northern flanks of the Alps during the evolution of cyclone Ilse . As shown in the upper‐right panel, the age of the tracer is 168 h (7 days): it was emitted on August 4 from the N‐Atlantic region ( ) and, after a long journey across the WMB, moved to the North again. The tracer reached the latitudes of the target area not so far from the region where it was released 7 days before, at that time flowing within a colder and drier air mass. There is a clear similitude between the position of the curved track of the tracer around the target and the area with high relative humidity at the 850 hPa level, depicted in . On August 11, while the tracer moved to the West, parallel to the northern flanks of the Alps, intense precipitations were recorded over the target region, and the pressure decreased to its minimum values. (middle and bottom) shows how cool N‐Atlantic air moved across northern France on August 12 and 13, in a direct NW‐to‐SE trajectory toward the target area, and encountered the old, moist, and warmer air mass located over the region. The frontal system formed by the two air masses is better observed in the right panels, looking at the age of the tracer over the target area. Intense precipitations were also recorded in the region during August 12, lasting until the early morning of August 13: the rainfall events moved into the E and NE region of the target area, following the slow movement of the frontal system. From 12 UTC August 12 until August 13 intense rain episodes were also observed in the western Black Sea region (Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine), moving from the SW to the NE of the region, ahead of the frontal system located over the Mediterranean Sea and associated with cyclone Ilse . The frontal system is clearly discernible in (right middle and right bottom), with the blue colors facing the more reddish colors of the old tracer. Next, we will show that the air mass running ahead of the frontal system at the Black Sea contains a larger fraction of the N‐African tracer, together with emissions from the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. To investigate the role of the N‐African accumulation layers, we have to track the trajectories of the tracer emitted from the blue colored region in . As observed in , the tracer does not penetrate deeply into the central Europe target area, but rather moves around the East and North boundaries of the region. However, during the severe rainfalls observed in the western Black Sea region (August 12–13), the N‐African tracer can be observed running ahead of the frontal system crossing the eastern Mediterranean on August 12 ( , middle and bottom): the tracer, previously accumulated in the N‐African middle troposphere, is now vented out with the southwesterlies over the western region of the Black Sea. The same panels in show the recovery of the normal/accumulation mode in the middle troposphere of N‐Africa, initiated by the restitution of the upper flow behind the frontal system (white arrows), as described by . According to our simulations, the air masses evaporated from the violet‐colored region in (Black Sea and Aegean) did not contribute to the precipitation in central Europe during the first stage of the episode ( , top and middle). On August 12, the tracer from this region is found, together with the N‐African one, over the area of Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, ahead of the frontal system crossing the Mediterranean: the joint tracer occupies a large band ( and , middle), which crosses the Aegean Sea, the western Black‐Sea, and continues to the NW over Poland into the Baltic Sea. This location coincides with the position of the water vapor front shown in both the MODIS data and the mesoscale model simulations ( , bottom). On August 13, during the final stage of the rainfall event in central Europe, the tracer emitted 3‐to‐4 days before from the Black Sea ( , bottom) moved into the northeastern border of the target area in central Europe, suggesting that evaporation from that region of the Black Sea could have been feeding the rainfall at the final stage of the episode. The exact location and quantification of the evaporative sources in this region are evaluated and mapped in a companion paper by . Thus, we can conclude that the intense rain episodes in the western Black Sea region from August 12 to 13, occurred when the N‐Atlantic air mass moving across the Adriatic Sea and flowing in the trailing region of the frontal system advancing along the Mediterranean Sea and southern Europe ( , middle), was uplifted over the mountain ranges of the Balkan Peninsula and faced the Black Sea region. The air mass located over the Black Sea at that time, moved ahead of the frontal system transporting water vapor evaporated locally at the region ( , middle) and further away, within the sea‐breeze convergence area of the Atlas Mountains ( , middle). Thus, the evaporative sources of the western Black Sea region episode had to be located in a vast region extending all along the western and central Mediterranean, northwestern Africa, probably including the subtropical Atlantic, and the landmass of southern Europe from Italy to the Black Sea. The target rainfall region of our search for water vapor sources was initially located in central Europe, and our mesoscale model domains were selected for the occasion. The size and resolution of the main domain appear reasonable for this investigation and although no conclusive statement can be drawn of possible, additional contributions from outside, the rainfall episode in the western Black Sea region seems to be affected by moisture sources located more to the south, outside the limit of grid #1: a large fraction of the N‐African and the Black Sea tracers is being lost at this grid's southern boundary ( and ). This is not the case for the N‐Atlantic air mass shown in . Thus, the analysis and mapping of the contribution of the former regions to the rainfall episode in eastern Europe (the western Black Sea) will need to extend the main model domain to the south. documents the coverage of the circulations transporting the moisture from the tropical mid‐troposphere to central and eastern Europe. and show meridional moisture flux (vx specific humidity), averaged for the 2 periods of cyclone activity over the Mediterranean Sea observed during the first two weeks in August 2002: when the cyclonic midlatitude circulation is shifted to the south, affecting the Mediterranean area, large amounts of mid‐troposphere moisture are released from the ITCZ and the subtropical environment northward. Once inserted in the cyclonic midlatitude circulation, the moisture can be released as precipitation. Alternatively, when the cyclone activity falls out of the area, as during the period August 6–9, the northward moisture flux is halted and the subtropical mid‐troposphere moisture circulates around northern Africa ( ) in a similar circulation to the one described by , with implications in the transport of desert dust and European pollution. This type of long‐range transport from the African ITCZ and the eastern Atlantic into Europe could also play an important role in the severe rainfall episodes that occur in the Mediterranean in autumn, as shown by , when the Mediterranean becomes an active zone of cyclogenesis. Thus, it is evident that further applications of our methodology to evaluate the evaporative sources of these types of episodes will need larger domains, mainly enlarged to the south (transport from the tropical mid‐troposphere) and to the west (transport from the N‐Atlantic region, as discussed in the companion paper). Conclusions The precipitation episode in August 2002 seemed to be caused by the concurrence of several ingredients needed for such an exceptional episode to happen: a) vapor accumulation in a large area in stably stratified layers within a non‐precipitating environment, b) a convergence mechanism to bring all that vapor to a smaller domain (an upper‐level trough, which deepened into a full scale depression as it encountered the moist and potentially unstable air mass accumulated over the WMB, provided the low level convergence and the upper‐level divergence) and c) a frontal and orographic lifting in a mountainous region, which allowed the release of the accumulated moisture in a more reduced domain. It is also important to notice that, for this episode, the inland propagation of the rainfall events into an exceptionally large region was favored by the efficiency of the vapor transport after evapo‐transpiration en route over lands already wet, which compensate the rainfall loses. This later feature resulted after consecutive precipitation episodes during a season characterized by midlatitude low tracks shifted more to the south, and crossing the Mediterranean area. Our analysis of the vapor accumulation from marine sources show that most of the precipitation taking place during the initiation of the central Europe rainfall episode (August 11–13, 2002) came from an air mass transported from the WMB. This air mass, initially of Atlantic origin, entered the Mediterranean through southern France over the Gulf of Lyon, and through northern Iberia channeled over the Ebro Valley. Once inside the basin, the western branch followed the combined upslope flows and coastal sea‐breezes of eastern Iberia and northern Africa during the August 6–9 accumulation period, while the eastern branch drifted slowly southwards, parallel to the Italian Peninsula. Finally, on August 10, after the irruption of the Vb cyclone Ilse into the Mediterranean, the water vapor accumulated in the WMB was transported, through the Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea, and across the western Balkans into the target area, initiating intense precipitations in central Europe on August 11. During the second half of the following day, a transition takes place from the Mediterranean origin of the air masses causing the rainfall, to an Atlantic origin. This change follows the irruption of air masses from the Atlantic in a direct NW‐to‐SE direction into the low pressure area developed on the target region. The colder Atlantic air masses were up‐lifted by the mountain ranges located in southeastern Germany, and they faced the Mediterranean air masses inside the target region: the frontal system formed by the two air masses moved slowly across the target region to the East and caused intense precipitation until the early morning of August 13. Evapo‐transpiration during the trajectory over the southeastern European landmass, before arriving at the precipitation areas on August 11, could have played an important role in increasing the available humidity for precipitation because of the presence of a moist land surface (the entire region had already sustained important precipitations on August 6–7). Our mesoscale model results show that precipitation during the trajectory over the Balkans into the target area would have most likely compensated the evapo‐transpiration, since the water vapor total column of the air mass causing severe rainfalls on August 11 remained constant from the Adriatic Sea to the target area. Terrestrial evaporative sources as well as their relative importance to marine sources are discussed by . The accumulation layers above the north‐African convergence region, the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea seem to be more related to the intense rainfall events observed in wide areas of the Black Sea region (Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine) during the second half of August 12 and 13. However, it is important to account that the caveat for this study is to have resorted to a limited area domain and time lapse. By the intrinsic definition of any regional model, the information from outside the domain comes from the boundary conditions. Whatever lies outside the boundaries is not part of the calculation: at this respect, when tracer trajectories cross the boundaries, nothing can be stated about their subsequent locations, even considering the fact that they could return back inside these boundaries if a larger domain and time lapse were selected. However, regardless of sources outside the domain, this study emphasizes the importance of subsidence over the WMB in the warm season as a prominent mechanism to accumulate moisture, that can be transported and released when a proper combination of forcings and triggering mechanisms are set in place. The same accumulation mechanisms could be relevant for other rainfall cases and they should be put into test. The implications for this important result are remarkable from the point of view of extreme precipitation forecasting in Europe.

While the transport of pollutants out of the Asian boundary layer (BL) and over the North Pacific Ocean has been extensively measured and studied (during the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM‐West) field campaign [e.g., ] and the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE‐P) field campaign [e.g., ; ; ; ]) and Asian pollutant plumes have been measured over the West Coast of the United States and in the eastern Pacific (during the Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation (ITCT) 2002 field campaign [e.g., ; ; ] and the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX‐B) field campaign [e.g., ; ]), relatively little is known about the processes that bring pollutant plumes down to the surface of the United States. In this study we examine in detail the large‐scale processes responsible for the downward transport of pollutant plumes, including their seasonality, distribution, and impact on surface O 3 . East Asian pollutants can be effectively lofted from the BL into the free troposphere (FT) by lifting ahead of midlatitude cyclones and deep convection [ ; , ; ; ] and then rapidly transported into North American air space by the free‐tropospheric westerlies. Transport that occurs exclusively in the Pacific BL accounts for only a small fraction of the total East Asian influence on O 3 mixing ratios during the spring season [ ]. This trans‐Pacific transport is episodic [ ; ], but both observations [ ; ; , ; ; ; ] and models [ ; ; ; ; ] have demonstrated that Asian pollutants can reach the North American FT every 3–9 days. Throughout the year this intermittent transport can produce a plume of Asian pollutants over North America [ ; ; ]. A majority of the Asian pollutants pass over North America, but a portion is brought down to the BL and can impact North American surface O 3 [ , ]. The spring season has the highest U.S. surface mixing ratios of O 3 produced from precursors originating from outside the United States [ ; ; ; ], with surface O 3 mixing ratios estimated to be 2–5 ppbv in the western United States, 1–3 ppbv in the central United States, and 0–1 ppbv in the eastern United States [ ]. Field campaigns in the western United States [e.g., ; ; ; ] suggest considerable O 3 production occurs in subsident air masses off the West Coast of the United States catalyzed by the NO x production from PAN decomposition. This study examines the seasonality, distribution, and large‐scale transport mechanisms of the Asian influence on surface O 3 in the United States. On the large scale, it provides modeling evidence for the dominant role of isentropic subsident transport of pollutants into the BL in postfrontal systems in the United States. However, there are several mechanisms that could transport air from the FT to the BL on smaller scales that may not be well resolved, such as downward transport due to the presence of mountains [e.g., ] and mountain valleys [e.g., ]. Transport due to the growth of the daytime mixed layer [e.g., ] and deep convection, while parameterized in the Community Atmospheric Model with Chemistry, are not explicitly resolved. The ability of synoptic scale transport to bring O 3 produced from Asian precursors to the surface depends on the intermittent presence of high‐O 3 pollutant plumes in the FT that these mechanisms can tap into. We show that the availability of this O 3 depends in turn on O 3 production over Asia, the transport of this O 3 to the United States, and the production or destruction of this O 3 en route. The relative importance of these various processes produce a springtime maximum of the Asian impact on O 3 mixing ratios at the surface and a summertime maximum in the upper troposphere. While it has been established that midlatitude cyclones can transport polluted BL air into the FT in the warm conveyor belt [e.g., ; ; ; ], transport of pollutants from the FT to the BL in the post‐cold front descending dry air stream is less well established [see ; ]. of this paper describes the methods, tracers, and simulation. explores the distribution and seasonality of O 3 A. explores mechanisms and evidence for the transport of O 3 A into the U.S. BL. explains the seasonal variations in O 3 A into transport and chemical components. compares the results of this study with other similar studies. Methods This study simulates the global circulation and chemistry for the years 2001 to 2005 using the offline version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM)–Community Atmospheric Model (CAM‐Chem) version 3.65, a three‐dimensional global circulation model driven by National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) offline meteorological fields [see ], with a 1.9° × 2.5° horizontal resolution and 28 vertical layers from the surface to 2.7 hPa. The offline meteorology is from the NCEP reanalysis data from 2000–2005. The initial year is not analyzed to allow for spin‐up. For a detailed description of the model, see . CAM‐Chem is a relatively modest extension of the well‐seasoned Model for Ozone and Related Tracers (MOZART). It uses the MOZART‐4 chemistry [ ] and the transport algorithms are similar. The procedure for inputting meteorological fields in CAM has been long established through the Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH) with extensions to the MOZART model [ ]. The MATCH model's ability to simulate individual events as well as interannual variability of constituents when driven by reanalysis data has been verified in many studies [e.g., ; ; ; ; and ]. The MOZART model has recently been thoroughly evaluated globally in and on a more regional basis over Mexico City in . A similar model setup of CAM‐Chem has been assessed in multimodel evaluations against surface measurements [ ], against vertical O 3 profiles [ ], or both [ ], and with respect to simulated intercontinental transport [ . Of particular note is CAM‐Chem's capacity to simulate free‐tropospheric O 3 very well as evaluated by ozonesonde measurements when compared with eleven other models participating in the HTAP project described by . Additional model evaluation of CAM‐Chem over the United States during the simulation years are given in the . Initial results and a more complete description of the MOZART‐4 chemistry utilized in CAM‐Chem are provided by and . Emissions for this simulation are the same as those from the HTAP runs [see ; ], which allows for a comparison of the results. The MOZART‐4 chemistry incorporated into CAM‐Chem is similar to that described in but includes additional tracer species and their associated reactions for tagging O 3 generated from Asian precursor species, as described below. The added tracers tag NO x anthropogenic and biofuel emissions over East Asia (xNO x ) and follow their chemical transformations throughout the total reactive nitrogen family. East Asia is defined as the area between 15°N and 50°N, and 95°E–160°E, which matches the definition of East Asia given by . The xNO x emissions have no interannual variability and thus the seasonality in xNO x is due to chemistry and transport. Any O 3 created as a result of xNO x emissions is tagged as O 3 A, which represents a molecule of O 3 that can be traced back to anthropogenic xNO x emitted over East Asia. This xNO x tagging procedure has been utilized in several previous studies [e.g., ; ]. found that away from the source regions of emissions, where NO x ‐O 3 nonlinearities are significant, the calculated O 3 A mixing ratios are comparable to those estimated by reducing the emissions of NO x by 100% [e.g., ]. In addition, several other tracers were included in these model simulations to further explore the details and mechanisms of O 3 transport and chemistry ( ). The artificial tracer O 3 Atr has its mixing ratio explicitly set to those of O 3 A over East Asia from the surface up to the 210 hPa layer. O 3 Atr has no explicit simulated chemistry or loss, but its mixing ratio is set to zero outside of a specified latitude and longitude range (see ). This prevents the buildup of O 3 Atr within the model and allows us to examine the impact of direct transport pathways of O 3 between Asia and North America assuming no chemical loss or production enroute. The second tracer, O 3 AtrCS (O 3 Atr with a constant source) is defined to represent the average transport of O 3 from Asia assuming there are no seasonal variations in Asian O 3 production. Since we do not know the average Asian O 3 production a priori we simulate the transport of the tracer (O 3 AtrCS*), where the mixing ratio ( M* ) of O 3 AtrCS* is set constant over the East Asian region year‐round from the surface to 210 hPa. We nominally set M* equal to 10 ppbv. O 3 AtrCS* has no explicit chemistry or loss and is set to zero outside of the specified latitude and longitude range. We define the tracer O 3 AtrC S as equal to S × O 3 AtrC S *, where S is a scaling factor applied so that at the receptor region the average value of O 3 AtrCS is equal to the average value of O 3 A. Note that this application of scaling at the receptor region is equivalent to scaling the mixing ratio at the source region by S . These tracers are used to examine the overall influence of the seasonality of transport and net chemistry on O 3 A mixing ratios ( ). While the coastal influence and complex topography of the western United States makes it particularly interesting when examining transport within the lower troposphere, it introduces transport processes that are not well resolved by the current generation of global models and thus limits our ability to isolate the transport and impacts of midlatitude cyclones. We therefore focus our analysis instead on the central United States, where CAM‐Chem is more likely to resolve the major transport processes associated with midlatitude cyclones. The topography of the central United States allows for well‐defined midlatitude cyclone systems without a strong coastal influence and still has a significant Asian influence (O 3 A represents around 5% of total O 3 ). For completeness, however, we include results for the western, central, and eastern United States in our analysis. O 3 A Distribution and Seasonality This section examines the five‐year seasonal average O 3 A plume between East Asia and North America. Daily variability of O 3 A mixing ratios is high, is strongly dependent on local meteorology, and is explored in the next section. Seasonally averaged O 3 A generally forms a plume originating at the surface in East Asia that extends into the FT and across the Pacific Ocean into the North American FT. shows the five‐year average O 3 A plume for each season at the surface layer, 500 hPa layer (around 5 km), and the 300 hPa layer (around 10 km). The O 3 A plume can be divided into two distinct seasonal regimes: the winter/spring regime and the summer/autumn regime. In the winter/spring regime, O 3 A mixing ratios are generally high (greater than 5 ppbv) in the BL and lower and middle FT extending from East Asia to the North American west coast. Overall, the highest mixing ratios are found in the BL directly over East Asia between 20 and 30 ppbv. Over the Eastern Pacific Ocean and western North America, the highest O 3 A mixing ratios (8–11 ppbv) are found in the middle FT (at 500 hPa) and extend from 20°N to 75°N over much of the Pacific Ocean and western North America. Both in the BL and in the upper FT over North America the winter/spring O 3 A mixing ratios are markedly lower (typically less than 5 ppbv). O 3 A mixing ratios up to 7 ppbv reach the Atlantic Ocean in the middle FT, while U.S. surface O 3 A mixing ratios are typically below 4 ppbv with maximum mixing ratios at the surface of the western United States. The summer/autumn regime has lower O 3 A mixing ratios at the surface over the Pacific Ocean (less than 5 ppbv) with high O 3 A mixing ratios (5–30 ppbv) concentrated in a latitudinal band between 20°N and 50°N and filling the middle and upper FT (6–10 km). Peak O 3 A values are found in the BL over East Asia, with a secondary peak in the upper FT directly over East Asia in excess of 20 ppbv. Values in the middle and lower FT over East Asia are generally between 10 and 20 ppbv. O 3 A mixing ratios comparable to the winter/spring regime reach the Atlantic Ocean in the lower FT. At the surface, O 3 A mixing ratios in the United States are lower than found in the winter/spring regime ( ). In the absence of diabatic heating and cooling, air parcels tend to move along isentropic surfaces rather than across them. gives the height cross‐section of the O 3 A plume as it is lifted over East Asia and is carried over the Pacific and North America, with isentropic surfaces plotted (black lines). only shows the spring and summer plumes, as they are representative of their respective regimes. The fact that the plume crosses isentropic surfaces over Asia and the Western Pacific indicates that diabatic heating is an important factor in governing its transport out of the BL. The summertime plume has a C‐shaped profile consistent with convective lifting associated with the East Asian summer monsoon season. The stronger lifting in the summer regime results in an O 3 A plume at higher altitudes than found in the spring regime. Over East Asia, the spring plume is lifted into the lower FT (below ∼6 km) and O 3 A mixing ratios do not exceed 20 ppbv. In contrast, the model simulations suggest the plume in the summer regime is convectively lifted up to the upper troposphere (10–12 km) with O 3 A mixing ratios in excess of 25 ppbv. Once in the FT, the Asian plume tends to be transported along isentropic surfaces across the Pacific in both regimes ( ). The spring O 3 A plume primarily enters the NA air basin below 5 km while the summer plume enters primarily above 5 km. shows a meridional slice of the average O 3 A plume near the western boundary of the United States (235°E) and in the central United States (260°E). Both the spring and summer regimes have O 3 A mixing ratios in excess of 5 ppbv in the FT at the North American west coast, but the peak O 3 A in the spring is around 10–11 ppbv and is found below 5 km while peak O 3 A in the summer is around 15–20 ppbv and is found in the upper FT. In addition, O 3 A in the spring at the West Coast of the United States is spread from 20°N to 50°N below 5 km, while O 3 A in the summer is found in a tight band centered at 40°N at 8 km. By the time the O 3 A plume reaches the central United States, it has decreased in mixing ratio and moved higher in altitude and farther north during both seasons. The impact of Asian pollution on surface O 3 in the United States depends on both the mixing ratios of O 3 A over the United States and the ability of meteorological events to bring the elevated mixing ratios in the O 3 A plume down to the surface. Transport processes within the FT and between the FT and the BL both contribute to the overall impact on surface O 3 . Isentropic transport mechanisms, such as transport in the dry air stream behind cold fronts, operate primarily along isentropic surfaces, as they lack the strong diabatic heating found during precipitation events required to result in significant cross isentropic transport. shows the mixing ratios of O 3 A along the isentropic surfaces that intersect the surface at 35°N and 235°E in the western United States, 260°E in the central United States, and 280°E in the eastern United States. In the central United States, this is the 295 K and 305 K potential temperature surface for the spring and summer, respectively ( ). In the western United States, this intersection is at a slightly lower potential temperature ( ), and in the eastern United States, the intersection is at a slightly higher potential temperature surface (data not shown). Therefore, at each location, this figure gives the potential O 3 A mixing ratios available for transport to the surface isentropically. These surfaces typically rise in altitude toward the north and intercept higher O 3 A mixing ratios at higher altitudes (see ). The winter (black) and spring (green) lines show that O 3 A mixing ratios in excess of 6 ppbv in each region can be easily “tapped” by isentropic motions, while the summer (blue) and autumn (red) lines show similar isentropic transport can only tap significantly lower mixing ratios of O 3 A. This transport is examined in . Transport to the U.S. Boundary Layer The simulation results for the seasonally averaged, density‐weighted O 3 A and O 3 mixing ratios for the western (35°N–50°N, 235°E–250°E), central (30°N–50°N, 250°E–270°E), and eastern (35°N–45°N, 270°E–285°E) United States and for the United States as a whole are summarized in and explored in this section. In addition, the O 3 A/O 3 fraction (%) for the surface, BL, and FT are also summarized to examine the contribution of O 3 A to total O 3 mixing ratios. Throughout this section, values are given as the mean ± one standard deviation over time. These results show that in the United States, total O 3 mixing ratios peak in the summer months at 39 ± 4.5, 47 ± 5.2, and 64.0 ± 8.5 ppbv in the western, central, and eastern United States, respectively. In the U.S. troposphere, the highest O 3 mixing ratios are found in the eastern summertime BL at 109 ± 14 ppbv. It is well known that this model, as well as many other global models, overestimate O 3 mixing ratios over the eastern United States in summer [ ; ; ; ]. This is examined further in , and discussed in the . O 3 A mixing ratios show a different seasonality. The highest O 3 A mixing ratios are found in the western United States, while the central and eastern United States have roughly 50% and 25%, respectively, of the western U.S. mixing ratios. The maximum Asian influence (i.e., O 3 A/O 3 ) at the surface is found in the spring in the western and central United States at 9.0%, 4.2%, and in the winter in the eastern United States at 1.7%. The following features are similar in all regions: (1) peak surface O 3 A is found in the spring; (2) peak BL O 3 A is found in the winter; (3) the minimum vertically averaged O 3 A mixing ratios in all regions of the troposphere occur primarily in the summer; and (4) the minimum Asian fractional influence at the surface is found in the summer, with 3.5%, 1.5%, and 0.3% in the western, central, and eastern United States, respectively. Throughout the United States, surface and BL O 3 A mixing ratios show more seasonal variability than the FT O 3 A mixing ratios, which is consistent with a year‐round average O 3 A plume in the FT over the United States. The seasonally averaged FT O 3 A results in do not indicate the summertime upper free tropospheric maximum. This feature is simply not evident when averaging across the entire FT. Midlatitude cyclones move over the United States on a synoptic timescale of 3–10 days, and play a dominant role in meteorology, transport, and air quality. A typical midlatitude cyclone consists of a low‐pressure system with a warm front extending eastward, and a cold front extending south and west. Ahead of the low‐pressure system, the warm conveyor belt (WCB) air stream lifts surface air into the FT, while behind the low‐pressure system, the dry air (DA) stream extends from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere down to the middle and lower troposphere, and can transport FT air to the top of the BL. Mixing processes within the BL act to transport the air to the surface [ , ]. This paper shows that these subsident, postfrontal air streams can “tap” free‐tropospheric O 3 A and impact surface O 3 mixing ratios. This process is particularly effective over the central United States, where low‐pressure systems are the most well defined and O 3 A mixing ratios are comparatively high. compares the surface O 3 A mixing ratios around the low‐pressure centers of 15 well‐defined, daily‐averaged low‐pressure systems in the central and midwestern U.S. for each season. For consistency of comparison, 15 low‐pressure systems were chosen for each season, although storm frequency is greatest in the winter [ ]. For each season, there are lower O 3 A mixing ratios ahead of the cold front (south and east of the low system) and higher O 3 A mixing ratios behind the cold front (west and north of the low system), but this signal is most pronounced during the springtime. The total increase in O 3 A that occurs during the passage of the springtime cold front is around 4 ppbv. However, there is no correlation noted between the strength of the low‐pressure system and the magnitude of the O 3 A increase (not shown). With the passage of a low‐pressure system, total O 3 has the opposite tendency to O 3 A and generally decreases with the passage of the cold front by approximately 5 ppbv for the 15 well‐defined low systems discussed here (data not shown). Besides the general decrease in O 3 with the passage of a low‐pressure system, there is no discernible pattern of O 3 structure around the center of the low. O 3 A Signal Decomposition The differences between various tracers (see ) highlight the different mechanisms that determine the budget of O 3 A over the United States. The following equation divides the total O 3 A into three distinct signals: _placeholder_formula_ Recall that O 3 AtrC S = S × O 3 AtrC S * ( ), where S represents the scaling factor used to calculate the baseline signal and S = 0.98 works well for all receptor regions. The three terms on the right hand side represent: (1) the transport of an inert tracer with a specified mixing ratio over East Asia to the United States (baseline), scaled to the annually averaged O 3 A mixing ratios over East Asia; (2) the impact of the seasonal variations in the mixing ratio of this tracer over East Asia, including seasonal variations in the vertical O 3 A profile (seasonality); (3) the net chemistry that occurs between the defined Asian source region and the United States (net chemistry). The sum of the baseline and seasonality signals is equal to the O 3 Atr tracer, and the sum of all three signals equal the total O 3 A tracer. compares these three signals along with the total O 3 A mixing ratios for the 2001–2005 composite years in the western and central United States at 300 hPa (top) and at the surface (bottom). These values are five‐year composite averages with the 1 standard deviation of the moving weekly averages shown in the shaded outlines. At the surface in both regions, there are high standard deviations in the spring and winter, with relatively low standard deviations in the summer. In addition, the 300 hPa layer shows high standard deviations during the summertime, which is consistent with high O 3 A plumes advecting through on a weekly time scale. O 3 A shows strong variation at the surface for both regions, with a peak in the spring and a minimum in the summer. The peak in the springtime (4 ppbv in the western United States and 2 ppbv in the central United States) at the surface can be explained by examining the contributions from all the three signals: (1) during the spring months the baseline signal is near its maximum, indicating the most robust transport of East Asian air to North America occurs during spring; (2) the seasonality signal is nearly maximum in the spring months, indicating that there are high mixing ratios of O 3 A in the source region over East Asia which can be transported to the United States; and (3) net chemistry, which reflects both chemical O 3 production from East Asian O 3 precursors and chemical loss en route is negative for all seasons for surface air. However, net chemistry has a broad seasonal maximum between October and April, suggesting minimal O 3 destruction during these months. The western United States shows a stronger seasonal cycle in net chemistry signal, which is not seen in the central United States. The central United States has a smaller biomass burning influence that the western United States, as well as fewer total emissions, and this could explain the differences between the two regions. Similarly, the summertime surface minimum in both regions can be explained by again decomposing the O 3 A mixing ratios into the three signals. In the summertime: (1) the baseline signal is nearly at its minimum, implying more indirect transport from East Asia to North America; (2) the seasonality signal is still at its maximum, but starts to decrease slightly in the late summer; and (3) the net chemistry signal is at its maximum net destruction and is nearly double that than found in the springtime. While this strong net negative chemistry signal is not seen in the central United States, the other two signals still account for the summertime O 3 A minimum. The seasonal variation of the 300 hPa chemistry signal is flatter with a broad winter‐spring maximum. At 300 hPa the chemistry signal plays a much smaller role, with the baseline and seasonality dominating the O 3 A signal. The summertime peak in the seasonality signal is consistent with a summertime peak in O 3 and O 3 precursors in the air over East Asia ( ). examines the net chemistry of the plumes more closely by plotting the net chemistry signal for the same meridional slices as in . This figure demonstrates: (1) net destruction in the U.S. BL during every season, (2) net chemical production in the FT in the springtime; (3) modest net chemical production in the FT in the western United States and modest net chemical destruction in the central United States during the summertime; and (4) a tight band of large chemical production in the upper FT in the summertime, especially in the western United States This tight band is limited to the upper free troposphere, as the much of the BL and lower FT shows predominant net chemical destruction during the summertime. The spring and autumn seasons show similar net chemistry signals, but the signals are relatively small (within ±1.0 ppbv of zero throughout most of the troposphere). The winter has moderate (between 1.0 and 1.5 ppbv) net chemical production in the lower FT, and less than 1.0 ppbv net chemical production in the middle and upper FT (not shown). Comparing and shows that the western United States has high summertime O 3 A mixing ratios (from 5–10 ppbv) and moderate net chemical production in the FT and parts of the BL, while the central United States has lower O 3 A mixing ratios (from 1–7 ppbv) and net chemical destruction throughout the BL and lower FT in the summer. The springtime O 3 A production seen at low latitudes and low altitudes in is consistent with PAN decomposition and O 3 production in subsiding branches of Asian plumes noted by , , and , . Comparisons to Other Modeling Studies summarizes results from (results from archived HTAP data with similar model version and set up as this study's simulation) and the results from this study, which were both obtained utilizing similar versions of CAM‐Chem. The results from this study are given as the average O 3 A mixing ratios over North America; in comparison the results are given as the O 3 changes over North America in response to 20% reductions of East Asian NO x emissions scaled by a factor of 5. found that far from source regions the impact of NO x emissions on O 3 A is equivalent to that derived by turning off the NO x emissions in the first place. examined the scaled differences in O 3 mixing ratios by decreasing NO x emissions by 20% and 100%. Nonlinearities in O 3 chemistry caused 100% reductions in NO x emissions to always result in larger O 3 responses than a 20% reduction of NO x emissions scaled by a factor of 5, with the nonlinearity strongest outside of the summer. Therefore, one would expect that impact of Asian emissions derived in this simulation to be higher than the scaled results; this study shows approximately 2–2.5 times the East Asian influence on North American O 3 than the results in the winter and spring and roughly double the results in the summer and autumn ( ). It should be noted that the results produced using CAM‐Chem were generally higher in simulated Asian influence on North American O 3 concentrations, particularly at the surface, in comparison to the other models [ ]. Conclusions The import of Asian pollutants into the western United States, and particularly the Pacific coast, has been extensively studied, as this region is most impacted by Asian emissions (O 3 A makes up ∼10% of total surface O 3 ) ( ). The eastern United States shows a significantly weaker O 3 A signal (O 3 A is ∼1% of total surface O 3 ) ( ), which can be attributed to: (1) strong influence of air from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico; (2) a less concentrated plume of O 3 A than is found over the western United States; and (3) stronger photochemical production and destruction near the surface, due in part to stronger local emissions. This study includes results for the entire United States ( ) but examines the central and midwestern regions more closely so as to examine the influence of midlatitude cyclones on the transport of Asian pollution from the FT to the surface. In general, Asian emissions create a plume of O 3 and O 3 precursors in the troposphere that extends over the Pacific Ocean and North America ( ). Our results suggest enhanced convection over East Asia plays a dominant role during the summertime, lofting O 3 A and its precursors into the upper troposphere, where they are then transported over the Pacific in the dominant midlatitude westerlies. In contrast, our results are consistent with warm conveyor belt transport playing the dominant role in East Asia in spring resulting in the lifting of O 3 A and its precursors to the lower and middle FT. This behavior exemplifies a winter/spring transport regime and a summer/autumn regime. These regimes impact the height and intensity of O 3 plumes from Asia as they cross the Pacific. We show that springtime O 3 A enters the U.S. air basin widely dispersed in the FT (2–6 km from 30 to 50°N) with a seasonally averaged peak of 10.0 ppbv (30°N at 2 km); summertime O 3 A enters the U.S. air basin ( ) in the upper FT (6–12 km) tightly centered on a higher peak of 11.0 ppbv (40°N at 8 km) but with a lower overall average of 6.0 ± 1.0 ppbv (mean ± one standard deviation). The surface O 3 A mixing ratios in the western United States (240°E) show a springtime maximum of 3.5 ± 1.0 ppbv (with daily peaks in individual grid cells reaching 10.0 ppbv) and a summertime minimum of 1.0 ± 0.25 ppbv. This surface springtime maximum and summertime minimum can be explained by: (1) the springtime O 3 A plume entering U.S. airspace in the lower free troposphere, while the summertime O 3 A plume enters in the upper free troposphere; (2) subsidence in the dry air stream associated with midlatitude cyclones, and other potential mechanisms that transport free tropospheric air to the surface of the United States can “tap” higher O 3 A mixing ratios during the springtime; and (3) higher O 3 A destruction occurs during transport to the surface of the United States in the summertime. Seasonal composites of low‐pressure systems in the central and midwestern United States ( ) show a strong increase in O 3 A mixing ratios (approximately 2 ppbv) with the passage of the cold front in the winter and spring, and a smaller increase (approximately 1 ppbv) in the summer and autumn. This indicates that low‐pressure systems can more effectively “tap” O 3 A in the winter/spring plumes than they can the summer/autumn plumes. The total O 3 A mixing ratio has been broken down into baseline, seasonality, and net chemistry signals ( ), which are determined by examining difference between artificial tracers. This analysis shows that the springtime O 3 A peak at the surface in the United States can be explained by: (1) strong baseline transport from Asia during the spring; (2) a strong seasonality signal, indicating high concentrations of O 3 and O 3 precursors over Asia during the spring; and (3) nearly minimum net chemical destruction during transport. In the summertime, the baseline and net chemical destruction signals tend to decrease surface O 3 A mixing ratios, resulting in a summertime minimum. The net chemistry signal ( ) shows strong net chemical destruction in the BL in the western and central United States in the summertime. In the springtime, strong net chemical destruction in the central United States extends up to the FT, while net chemical destruction in the western United States is limited to the BL. Net chemical production is seen in the lower FT and parts of the BL in the western United States, indicating that there may be O 3 production in the BL in the western United States during the spring. However, the results from this study indicate that for most of the country, it is O 3 produced over East Asia, rather than O 3 produced during transport, that primarily impacts U.S. surface O 3 concentrations. These conclusions apply primarily to the seasonal averages, and individual daily orhourly events may show a different signal. The results from this study show that, while O 3 A will still exacerbate summertime O 3 peaks, the largest Asian impact on surface O 3 in the United States will be in the springtime.

Aerosols exert a strong influence on the atmospheric energy budget and therefore climate, primarily through two mechanisms: a radiative (direct) effect and a microphysical (indirect) effect. The aerosol radiative effect is associated with the scattering and absorption of solar radiation [e.g., Charlson et al ., ]. Scattering acts to cool the air, while absorption acts to warm it. Absorbing aerosols, such as black carbon and mineral dust, can cause substantial diabatic heating in the atmosphere, which can enhance cloud evaporation or inhibit cloud formation [e.g., Ackerman et al ., ; Koren et al ., ]. The aerosol microphysical effect is associated with aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei [ Twomey , ], which can modify the size distribution of cloud droplets and ice particles. These modifications affect internal cloud microphysics, cloud radiative properties and precipitation efficiency, and, by extension, the atmospheric hydrological cycle and energy balance [e.g., Jiang and Feingold , ; Jiang et al ., ]. Both the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols can have complicated impacts on weather and climate systems [e.g., Koren et al ., ]. Taken together with incomplete knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of aerosols and their spatial and temporal distributions, these aerosol effects represent major sources of uncertainty in both the attribution of past climate changes and the prediction of future climate changes [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , ]. The estimates of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on climate in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report are largely based on climate model simulations, partly due to the fact that aerosol observations were inadequate and had large uncertainties. Evaluating and characterizing aerosol impact on climate requires high resolution (both horizontally and vertically) and long‐term continuous observations of aerosols, which have large temporal and spatial variations. The vertical variability of aerosols in the atmosphere has been less well studied than the horizontal variability, largely because it is more difficult to sample aloft than from a ground‐based platform. However, the vertical profiles of aerosol played an important role in determining aerosol radiative forcing. For example, Haywood and Ramaswamy [ ] argued that the vertical distribution of aerosols is important in determining the magnitude and sign of aerosol direct radiative forcing. More recently, Rozwadowska [ ] have found that errors in the assumptions about the shape of aerosol profiles can cause errors in satellite retrieval of aerosol optical thickness. Meanwhile, many previous analyses of aerosol vertical distributions were confined to small spatial scales with focus on a specific city or region due to coverage limitations [e.g., Li et al ., ; Osborne and Haywood , ; Hains et al ., ]. Aircraft missions are still used today to collect aerosol samples and measure aerosol size distributions [ Kaufman et al ., ; Shinozuka et al ., ; Liu et al ., ], and ground‐based lidar data [e.g., Chazette , ; Matthias et al ., ; Huang et al ., ] are still necessary to examine vertical profiles of aerosol extinction as most satellite data are restricted to column values or averages. However, due to continued advancement of remote sensing technology, new tools are becoming available to study aerosol profiles. The new aerosol profile data derived from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) provide an opportunity to assess model simulations of aerosol vertical distributions on global and annual scales. Since the launch of CALIPSO, various methods have been employed to use the data. For example, the CALIPSO data have been used in concert with model simulations and other satellite instruments to evaluate aerosol vertical distributions [ Huang et al ., ; Bou Karam et al ., ; Yu et al ., ], validate model simulations [ Generoso et al ., ], and assimilate observations into models to correct for nonhomogeneous background error statistics [ Sekiyama et al ., ]. Yu et al . [ ] examined seasonal variations of aerosol vertical distributions through an analysis of 18‐month CALIPSO data and compared with model aerosol simulations as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. However, their work mainly focused on comparisons between satellite observations and model simulations of aerosol optical property and did not include aerosol type distribution and diurnal variations of aerosol properties. Despite previous efforts to evaluate aerosol vertical distributions, a lack of assessment of global, climatological, as well as diurnal variations of aerosol vertical distributions still exists. Given the current need for a better understanding of the vertical distributions and variations of aerosols in order to quantify aerosol effects on climate change and the hydrological cycle through model simulation, this study aims to: (1) analyze climatological regional and seasonal variations of the vertical distribution of aerosol optical and type properties using 5‐year CALIPSO observations and (2) evaluate diurnal variations of the vertical distribution of different aerosol properties. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: a brief description of CALIPSO measurements, Level 3 aerosol data, and quality information are given in . The climatological seasonal variations of aerosol extinction and type profiles, as well as the maximum aerosol layer top altitudes, in different aerosol regime regions are presented and discussed in . discusses the diurnal variations of aerosol vertical distributions. Major findings and conclusions are summarized in . Data Sets The CALIPSO satellite was launched into a Sun‐synchronous orbit on 28 April 2006 with a local equator‐crossing time of about 1:30 P.M. and 1:30 A.M., with a 16‐day repeating cycle. The primary instrument on board CALIPSO is the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), which is a dual‐wavelength polarization lidar designed to acquire vertical profiles of attenuated backscatter from a near nadir‐viewing geometry during both day and night phases [ Winker et al ., ]. Since then, it has become one member of the A‐Train [ L'Ecuyer and Jiang , ] satellite constellation and has been collecting almost continuously high‐resolution (333 m in the horizontal and 30 m in the vertical below 8.3 km) profiles of the attenuated backscatter by aerosols and clouds at 532 and 1064 nm wavelengths along with polarized backscatter at 532 nm between 82°N and 82°S [ Winker et al ., ]. Spatial averaging over different scales is usually taken to improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) for reliable aerosol retrieval. The features identified by CALIPSO are first classified into aerosol and cloud using a cloud‐aerosol discrimination (CAD) algorithm [ Liu et al ., ]. The level of confidence in the aerosol‐cloud classification is reflected by a CAD score, with negative values (−100 to 0) for aerosol and positive values (+100 to 0) for cloud. The larger absolute value of this score represents the higher confidence of the feature classification. After an aerosol layer is identified, the scene classification algorithm further categorizes the aerosol layer to one of six aerosol types by using input parameters, including altitude, location, surface type, volume depolarization ratio, and integrated attenuated backscatter measurements [ Omar et al ., ]. The six aerosol types are smoke (biomass burning aerosol), polluted continental (urban/industrial pollution), polluted dust (mixture of dust and smoke), dust (desert), clean continental (clean background), and clean marine (sea salt). Each aerosol type has a preassigned lidar ratio (or an extinction‐to‐backscatter ratio) which is later used in the retrieval of aerosol extinction. More details can be found in recent papers [e.g., Liu et al ., ; Omar et al ., ; Young and Vaughan , ; Winker et al ., ]. Aerosol extinction is retrieved by the Hybrid Extinction Retrieval Algorithms using the assumed lidar ratios appropriate for each aerosol type [ Young and Vaughan , ] and reported in the CALIPSO Level 2, 5‐km aerosol profile product. The determination of lidar ratio is one of the major factors affecting the uncertainty of CALIPSO aerosol extinction retrieval, and the misclassification of aerosol type is another source of uncertainty [ Yu et al ., ]. In addition, another important source of uncertainty in the aerosol profile retrieval occurs when the base of the aerosol layer is incorrectly identified (e.g., above the true layer base). To compensate for cases where the aerosol layer base is identified too high, a “Layer Base Extension” algorithm has been adopted in CALIPSO Level 2 Version 3.0 retrieval that extends the base of the lowest aerosol layer in the column to 90 m above the local surface for layers having positive mean attenuated backscatter 532 nm that are within 2.5 km of the surface [ CALIPSO , ]. The assumption is that boundary layer aerosols are often surface attached and extending the base allows the usable signal below the original base to contribute to column AOD, reducing the low AOD bias. Moreover, if the aerosol attenuated backscatter signal is below the instrument sensitivity of 2–4 × 10 −4 km −1 sr −1 in the troposphere [ Winker et al ., ], CALIOP will miss such features. Because retrieval errors propagate downward, the lower parts of the aerosol profile always have higher uncertainty and may contain more retrieval artifacts. The CALIOP is less sensitive during daytime than nighttime due to SNR reduction by solar background illumination [ Liu et al ., ]; thus, weakly scattering (or optically thin) layers which are detected during nighttime may be missed during daytime. It is important to keep this fact in mind when interpreting diurnal variations in the occurrence frequency of aerosol type and maximum aerosol layer top altitude. The CALIPSO Version 3.0 Level 2 data products have significant improvements over previous versions, which have been demonstrated by previous validation studies [e.g., Kacenelenbogen et al ., ; Redemann et al ., ; Koffi et al ., ]. In this study, we use the recently released CALIPSO Version 1.0 Level 3 aerosol profile data, a globally gridded monthly product derived from CALIPSO Version 3.0 Level 2, 5‐km aerosol profile product [ Powell et al ., ]. The Level 2 aerosol profile data are first quality screened and then aggregated onto a global 2° × 5° latitude‐longitude grid. The vertical resolution is 60 m, from −0.4 to 12.1 km above mean sea level (amsl), with a total of 208 layers [ Powell et al ., ]. Averaged profile data after quality screening are reported for all‐aerosol (regardless of type) and for mineral dust aerosol only. Classification of dust is based on the aerosol type flags in the Level 2 profile data. Aerosol type information from Level 2 data is also reported in Level 3 as histograms of aerosol type for each latitude/longitude/altitude grid cell, including all six aerosol types. Depending on the sky condition (combined, i.e., cloud‐free + above cloud, or all‐sky) and lighting condition (daytime or nighttime), there are four different types of Level 3 data files. The primary variables included in these data are vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient at 532 nm, aerosol type, spatial distribution, and AOD. The quality screening strategy adopted in Level 3 data production used several filters designed to eliminate samples and layers that were detected or classified with very low confidence or that have unreliable extinction retrievals. These filters include quality control (QC) flags contained in the Level 2 data (e.g., CAD score, extinction QC, and extinction uncertainty) and newly developed filters (e.g., misclassified cloud filter) [ CALIPSO , ]. Only aerosol layers having a CAD score between −100 and −20 are used in Level 3 data. However, sources of uncertainty or biases can still exist, including possible low bias near the surface, surface contamination, weaker SNR at daytime, and incorrectly assumed lidar ratio. Currently, the CALIPSO science team cautions Level 3 data users against physical interpretation of near‐surface aerosol extinction (within 180 m of the local surface), which may be compromised by surface contamination errors [ CALIPSO , ]. Thus, the analyses in this paper ignore samples within 180 m of the maximum surface elevation in attempts to remove these errors, though we still suggest treating extinction reported in the lowest range bin with caution. As mentioned above, daytime signals can be affected by background sunlight, reducing SNR, and feature detection sensitivity, especially in the upper level. Therefore, aerosol extinction in the upper troposphere is underestimated in the Level 3 data product due to misdetection of optically thin aerosol [ Winker et al ., ]. This not only impacts mean aerosol extinction profiles at higher altitudes shown in this paper, but also impacts diurnal comparisons of the occurrence frequency of aerosol type and maximum layer top altitude. Thus, the results of aerosol diurnal variation shown in this paper are preliminary, although observations associated with possible natural diurnal variability are noted. An important contributor to the uncertainty in CALIPSO Level 3 aerosol extinction statistics is the assumed lidar ratios adopted for the various aerosol types. The lidar ratio typically varies by about 30% for a given aerosol type, and different types have different magnitudes of variability [ Omar et al ., ; Yu et al ., ]. Incorrect aerosol type classification can affect Level 3 mean aerosol extinction. For example, if a feature that is actually smoke is misclassified as clean marine, the extinction will be too small by over a factor of 3. The frequency of aerosol type misclassification and its impact on Level 3 aerosol extinction has not been quantified and is currently under investigation. Despite these uncertainties, Winker et al . [ ] have shown that these Level 3 aerosol data are realistic and representative for aerosol extinction greater than about 0.001 km −1 and up to an altitude of 4–6 km in most cases. Thus, in the following analyses, we use 0.001 km −1 as the lowest bound of aerosol extinction detected by CALIPSO and only discuss aerosol extinction larger than this value. The time period we used is from March 2007 to February 2012, for a total of 5 years. Because of their better SNR compared to the daytime measurements, only CALIPSO nighttime measurements at 532 nm will be used to analyze climatological regional and seasonal variations of the vertical distribution of aerosol optical and type properties. We use all‐sky data in this study. The seasonal vertical profiles of aerosol extinction are calculated based on each domain average, i.e., the average of all grid cells included within each domain box. Seasonal Variation of the Vertical Distribution of Aerosol Properties In order to characterize the regional difference of the aerosol distribution, we choose 13 domains and divide them into four groups according to their aerosol regimes (Figure ). The first group includes South America (SAM, 80°W–40°W, 25°S–5°N), southern Africa (SAF, 0°E–50°E, 25°S–15°N), and Southeast (SE) Asia (SEA, 100°E–160°E, 15°S–15°N), where biomass burning aerosols dominate; the second group includes northern Africa (NAF, 15°W–60°E, 15°N–35°N), west China (WCN, 70°E–105°E, 31°N–45°N), and west Australia (WAU, 110°E–140°E, 15°S–35°S), comprising large desert areas; the third group includes India (IND, 65°E–90°E, 11°N–29°N), east China (ECN, 105°E–125°E, 21°N–45°N), west Europe (WEU, 10°W–50°E, 35°N–59°N), and East U.S. (EUS, 90°W–70°W, 25°N–49°N), where fossil fuel burning and industry generated aerosols are most common; the fourth group includes northwest (NW) Pacific (NWP, 135°E–170°E, 31°N–55°N), North Atlantic (NAT, 60°W–20°W, 25°N–49°N), and central Atlantic (CAT, 40°W–10°W, 15°S–15°N), which are oceanic regions located downwind of major dust and industrial pollution sources. The African savanna region to the north of the equator is an important biomass burning region [e.g., Huang et al ., ], so we include this region in the southern Africa domain. Biomass Burning Regime Figure shows the seasonal aerosol vertical profile of the extinction coefficient for the biomass burning regime areas. In South America, the aerosol extinction profile generally shows a monotonically decreasing pattern from the surface to the upper level during all seasons, except austral winter (JJA) and spring (SON) seasons. The maximum extinction occurs near the surface in SON, which corresponds to the strongest biomass burning during this period [ Dwyer et al ., ; van der Werf et al ., ; Huang et al ., ]. Since biomass burning aerosol is the dominant aerosol in this region, dust extinction is much less than all‐aerosol extinction at all levels. In southern Africa, the all‐aerosol extinction profile shows two peaks during austral winter and spring, at ~500 m and 3 km. The lower peak is probably due to the strong biomass burning during the dry seasons [ Dwyer et al ., ]. During austral fall and winter, dust extinction appears much closer to all‐aerosol extinction above 4 km than lower levels, suggesting the larger impact of dust in the upper levels. In SE Asia, the aerosol extinction profile does not show much seasonal variation, possibly due to the little seasonal variation of fire emissions in this region [ Duncan et al ., ]. Moreover, only one peak occurs near the surface (~500 m) during all seasons, which is different from southern Africa. Similar to South America, dust contributes little to the all‐aerosol extinction. To characterize the occurrence frequency distribution of different aerosol types, we calculate each aerosol type occurrence frequency by dividing the number of aerosol type samples by the total number of CALIPSO measurements (including both clear air and aerosol) within each vertical layer. The total numbers of aerosol samples (after data screening) detected by CALIPSO at each layer are shown in the Appendix (Figures ). Generally, CALIPSO detects more aerosol samples during nighttime than daytime, especially in the middle to upper troposphere, and there are fewer aerosol samples detected at high altitudes. Figure shows the vertical profile of each aerosol type occurrence frequency during each season. In South America, smoke is the dominant aerosol type detected at 2–8 km during all seasons. During the strongest biomass burning season (SON), it is also the dominant type detected near the surface (~1 km). Polluted dust, which is intended to represent a mixture of smoke and dust [ Omar et al ., ], is the dominant aerosol detected at 1–2 km except SON when polluted continental aerosol dominates. The altitude of smoke occurrence frequency larger than 0.1% is highest in SON, at ~9 km. In southern Africa, aerosol occurrence frequency has large seasonal variations. Smoke dominates above 6 km in nearly all seasons. In MAM, dust is the dominant aerosol detected from 1 to 6 km, while polluted dust is the secondary dominant type. In JJA, dust only prevails from 4 to 7 km, and smoke prevails from 1 to 4 km. In SON, smoke becomes the dominant aerosol detected from ~2.5 km to the upper troposphere (~11 km), consistent with the strongest biomass burning during this period. Dust aerosol occurrence is lowest compared to other seasons. In DJF, polluted dust appears as the most prevailing aerosol type detected from near the surface to 6 km, while dust is the secondary type. The complexity of seasonal aerosol type variation reflects the significant impacts of both biomass burning and desert on the aerosol composition in this region. In SE Asia, aerosol types show little seasonal variation. Throughout the year, smoke is the dominant type detected above 4 km, with a frequency peak of ~0.03 around 4 km in SON. Clean marine aerosol appears to be the dominant type detected below 4 km, due to a large oceanic area in this domain. Polluted dust is the secondary type at nearly all levels, but its occurrence frequency is comparable with that of clean marine and smoke detected around 4 km. To further characterize the vertical distribution of the aerosol layer, we also analyzed the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitudes detected by CALIPSO. The Level 3 aerosol data provide the distributions of the highest aerosol layer top altitudes detected within each latitude/longitude grid cell, which are stored in 11‐element percentile arrays with the first value containing the minimum layer top altitude and the last containing the maximum [ CALIPSO , ]. The occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude in the i th 500 m vertical bin ( f i ) is calculated as _placeholder_formula_ . N i is the number of times when the maximum aerosol layer top altitude detected by CALIPSO falls in the i th 500 m vertical bin, n is the total number of 500 m vertical bins. The results are shown in Figure . In South America, the altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust aerosol layer top is significantly lower than that of all‐aerosol in nearly all seasons. The altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust layer top is ~3 km throughout the year, while that for all‐aerosol can be as high as 7 km during wet seasons (DJF and MAM). In southern Africa, the altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust layer top is much closer to that of all‐aerosol in MAM and JJA than in other seasons, possibly due to the dominant role of dust in the upper level aerosol composition. The dust layer top altitude has two frequency peaks in JJA, with the peak at ~5 km close to the solitary peak of all‐aerosol and larger than the peak at ~1 km, suggesting that dust is detected more at a higher level than near the surface. In SE Asia, the occurrence frequency of the aerosol layer top altitude shows little seasonal variation, with a peak altitude at ~7 km for all‐aerosol and ~1–2 km for dust. Dust appears to be mostly restrained in the boundary layer. In general, over biomass burning regime areas, smoke is the dominant aerosol type detected from the lower to middle troposphere. Dust contributes little to the all‐aerosol extinction from the surface to the lower troposphere and has a lower altitude of peak occurrence frequency than all‐aerosol. However, due to different geographic location and meteorological conditions, each region also has its unique features. In South America, the altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the all‐aerosol layer top is higher during wet seasons than dry seasons (JJA and SON). In southern Africa, dust is a significant component of the aerosols during MAM and JJA, especially in the upper level. In SE Asia, both aerosol extinction and types show little seasonal variations, partly due to the little seasonal variation of aerosol emissions. Desert Regime The Sahara, Arabian, Gobi, and Taklamakan deserts are among the largest deserts in the world: the former two are included in the northern Africa domain, and the latter two are included in the west China domain. The Great Victoria and Great Sandy deserts are the two largest deserts in Australia and are included in the west Australia domain. The seasonal vertical profiles of aerosol extinction for these desert regime areas are shown in Figure . In northern Africa, the dust extinction profile is highly overlapped with the all‐aerosol extinction profile, especially during MAM and JJA, suggesting the overwhelming role of dust in the aerosol composition over this region. During DJF, the dust contribution to all‐aerosol extinction is weaker than other seasons, particularly above 2 km, and the extinction decreases more rapidly with altitude. The maximum altitude of the dust extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is ~7 km in JJA, ~6 km in MAM and SON and ~4.5 km in DJF. The largest extinction near the surface occurs in JJA (greater than 0.2 km −1 ). In west China, the overlap only occurs in MAM, corresponding to the annual heavy dust storm during boreal spring season [e.g., Husar et al ., ]. Moreover, aerosol extinction reaches the largest value near the surface (greater than 0.3 km −1 ) also in MAM. Although aerosol extinction is largest at the surface and decreases with altitude, there is a secondary peak around ~2.5 km during MAM and JJA. Aerosol extinction decreases more rapidly with altitude during DJF than other seasons. The maximum altitude of aerosol extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is ~7.5 km in MAM and JJA and ~6–6.5 km in SON and DJF. In west Australia, the pattern is totally different from the former two regions. The dust extinction profile is far away from the all‐aerosol extinction profile, suggesting dust contributes little to the all‐aerosol extinction. The low dust output may be partly explained by the fact that the continent has relatively low topographical relief, and the arid regions are old and highly weathered, i.e., fine particles were blown away a long time ago [ Prospero et al ., ]. Both dust and all‐aerosol extinction decrease monotonically with altitude. The maximum extinction of dust near the surface is less than 0.01 km −1 . During MAM and JJA, the maximum altitude of aerosol extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is ~1–1.5 km lower than that during SON and DJF. Regarding the aerosol type distribution (Figure ), the three domains have quite distinct features. In northern Africa, dust is the dominant aerosol type with an occurrence frequency more than 50% and nearly constant detected from ~1 to ~4 km during all seasons except DJF, and polluted dust is the secondary type. Above 4 km, the dust occurrence frequency decreases rapidly with altitude. The maximum altitude of the dust occurrence frequency larger than 0.1% is 10 km in MAM, 9 km in JJA, and 7 km in SON and DJF. Both dust and polluted dust are dominant types above 4 km in DJF. The occurrence frequency of other aerosol types is negligible compared with the former two types (the large frequency of clean marine aerosol near 0 m amsl occurs over the small oceanic regions in the NAF domain; see Figure ). In west China, the dust occurrence frequency peaks near the surface and decreases rapidly with altitude in all seasons except MAM. During MAM, the dust occurrence frequency is still larger than 2% and 0.1% detected at 8 and 11 km, respectively. Similar to northern Africa, polluted dust is the secondary type, with the occurrence frequency comparable to dust in the upper level. Although smoke is the third dominant type, its occurrence frequency is about 1 order of magnitude less than polluted dust. In west Australia, polluted dust is the dominant type detected from ~1 to ~5 km, and smoke dominates above 5 km in all seasons except JJA. During JJA, smoke becomes the dominant type above 3 km. The maximum occurrence frequency of dust is less than 5% in MAM and JJA and ~10% near the surface in SON and DJF. To some extent, the aerosol type occurrence frequency over this region is similar to some biomass burning areas (e.g., South America). Figure shows the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitudes. In northern Africa, the frequency profiles of dust and all‐aerosol are closely overlapped in MAM and JJA, again suggesting the dominant role of dust. The altitude of the peak frequency is significantly higher in MAM and JJA than the other two seasons. A remarkable feature is that a secondary all‐aerosol frequency peak (greater than 2%) occurs at ~18 km only during JJA. This peak suggests that an aerosol layer may exist at the tropopause level, which is presumably associated with the Asian tropopause aerosol layer as first discovered by Vernier et al . [ ]. In west China, during the strong dust storm season (MAM), the frequency profile of dust overlaps with that of all‐aerosol. During other seasons, the altitude of the dust peak frequency is slightly lower than that of all‐aerosol. Similar to northern Africa, a secondary all‐aerosol frequency peak (~3%) occurs at ~18 km only during JJA. In west Australia, the dust layer occurs most frequently in the boundary layer except in DJF, consistent with the little fraction of dust in aerosol composition. There are two frequency peaks of all‐aerosol during MAM and JJA: one at ~7 km and the other at ~4 km. During SON and DJF, the peak frequency of all‐aerosol occurs at ~5 km. In general, over desert regime areas, dust is the dominant aerosol type from the surface to the middle troposphere and sometimes can extend to above 8 km. Dust contributes significantly to the all‐aerosol extinction and has nearly the same layer top altitude of the peak occurrence frequency as all‐aerosol. However, west Australia is an exception. Despite the desert and arid surface type, the aerosol characteristics in this region are closer to the biomass burning regime rather than the desert regime. This is mainly due to two reasons: first, the continent has relatively low topographical relief, and the arid regions are old and highly weathered [ Prospero et al ., ]; second, both northern and western regions of Australia have active fire seasons [ Giglio et al ., ], with substantial emissions of biomass burning generated aerosol. A notable common feature in northern Africa and west China is a secondary peak (2%–3%) of the layer top occurrence frequency of all‐aerosol at ~18 km only during JJA, suggesting the existence of an aerosol layer at the tropopause level during boreal summer. Fossil Fuel and Industry Regime In India, east China, west Europe, and East U.S., fossil fuel, biofuel burning, and industry generated aerosols are a major part of the total aerosol loading [ Duncan et al ., ]. Figure shows the seasonal vertical profiles of aerosol extinction for these four domains. In India, the extinction profile of dust is close to that of all‐aerosol in MAM and JJA, suggesting the significant contribution of dust which is presumably transported from the nearby Thar and Arabian deserts. Moreover, dust with extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 can reach as high as 6 km, about 1.5–2.5 km higher than that in SON and DJF. The maximum extinction occurs at the surface and decreases with altitude. During JJA, surface aerosol extinction is close to 0.5 km −1 , ~2–3 times larger than during other seasons. During SON and DJF, aerosol extinction decreases more rapidly with altitude than during MAM and JJA, and the maximum extinction occurs slightly above the surface. In east China, dust contribution is much weaker than in India. During MAM, the dust extinction profile is closer to the all‐aerosol extinction profile than during other seasons, due to the strong transport of dust from west China. The shape of the all‐aerosol extinction profile does not change much throughout the year, but the maximum altitude of extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 has seasonal change, with the highest altitude at ~7 km in MAM. In west Europe, dust appears to contribute more to all‐aerosol extinction in the upper level than the lower level, especially in MAM and JJA. The maximum altitude of all‐aerosol extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is highest in JJA (~6 km) and lowest in DJF (~4.5 km). In East U.S., the dust extinction profile is far away from the all‐aerosol extinction profile and decreases rapidly with altitude. This is not surprising since no big desert is included in this domain or nearby. The maximum altitude of all‐aerosol extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is about 1.5 km higher in MAM and JJA than in other seasons. The seasonal vertical profile of each aerosol type occurrence frequency is shown in Figure . In India, dust dominates from near the surface to as high as 10 km in MAM, and polluted dust is the secondary type; other aerosol types are trivial. In JJA and SON, the type distribution is complicated because dust, polluted dust, and smoke all play important roles. For example, in SON, polluted dust, dust, and smoke dominate at 1–3, 3–5.5, and 5.5–8 km, respectively. However, smoke always dominates at higher levels than dust. In DJF, all‐aerosol types are limited below 6 km. In east China, dust dominates above 2 and 3 km in MAM and DJF, respectively, while polluted dust dominates in the lower level. Dust with an occurrence frequency larger than 0.1% can reach as high as 11 km during MAM. In JJA and SON, similar to India, all three types are important. However, dust dominates at higher levels than smoke, which is different from India. In west Europe, dust dominates above 3 km in all seasons except DJF, but the maximum altitude has seasonal change. The higher occurrence frequency of smoke above 8 km in JJA and SON may be artificial due to misclassification. Polluted dust dominates below 3 km in all seasons except DJF. Aerosols are classified as smoke less often than dust and polluted dust in this region. This could be caused by smoke and dust mixing in the lower troposphere and being classified as polluted dust or could be because smoke does not contribute significantly to total aerosol loading. During DJF, the aerosol occurrence frequency is much less than during other seasons and mostly limited below 6 km. In East U.S., aerosol classified as polluted dust dominates in the lower to middle troposphere and up to 6 km. However, polluted dust can reach as high as 10 km in MAM and JJA. Smoke prevails above 5 km during JJA and SON. Dust is detected as the dominant type at 6–8 and 5–7 km over this region during MAM and DJF, respectively. As for the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitudes, the four regions have similar patterns (Figure ). Generally, the altitude of the dust frequency peak is lower than that of all‐ aerosol. However, there are some exceptions. During MAM in both India and east China, the altitudes of the peak occurrence frequency for dust and all‐aerosol are closely overlapped, due to the overwhelming dust in the aerosol loading. During MAM and JJA in west Europe, the altitudes of the frequency peak for the two types are also nearly the same, which may be due to the more significant impact of dust in the upper level than the lower level, as shown by the extinction profiles (Figure ). Similar to northern Africa and west China, a secondary occurrence frequency peak (2%) of all‐aerosol occurs at ~18 km only during JJA over India and east China, again suggesting the existence of a tropopause aerosol layer only during this season. In general, over fossil fuel and industry regime areas, the dominant aerosol types include polluted dust, smoke, and dust, with each type dominating at different levels. The dominant aerosol types also have large geographical and seasonal variations. Dust contribution to the all‐aerosol extinction is highly dependent on the location and season. If big desert areas are included in the domain or nearby, dust can play an important role during some specific periods (e.g., MAM in India and east China). During other periods, dust has little impact on the all‐aerosol extinction and has lower altitude of the peak occurrence frequency than all aerosol. A notable common feature again shows up in India and east China, i.e., a distinct secondary layer top frequency peak of all‐aerosol occurs at ~18 km only during JJA (Figure ). Oceanic Regime Oceans serve as a significant source of gaseous and aerosol emissions, due to their coverage of more than two thirds of the Earth surface. The emissions from oceans could mix with ship and continental emissions and form a complicated mixture of marine aerosol particles. Thus, the sources and properties of marine aerosols can be affected by ocean emissions, ship exhaust, and transported continental emissions [ Sorooshian and Duong , ]. Here we choose three oceanic regions, and their seasonal vertical profiles of aerosol extinction are shown in Figure . Over NW Pacific, dust contributes little to the all‐aerosol extinction throughout the year. However, dust still has some impact on the boundary layer during JJA, with dust extinction decreasing rapidly with altitude. The maximum altitude of extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is highest in MAM, ~6 km for dust, and ~8 km for all‐aerosol. This is consistent with the well‐known trans‐Pacific transport of dust at 4–6 km during this period [e.g., Husar et al ., ; Eguchi et al ., ]. During other seasons, dust is mostly restrained in the lower troposphere and has local impact. Over North Atlantic, the seasonal pattern of all‐aerosol is similar to that over NW Pacific, except that the maximum altitude of extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is much lower. The maximum altitude is ~5.5 km in MAM and JJA and ~4.5 km in SON and DJF. As for dust, the maximum altitude is highest in JJA (~5 km). Dust impact is much larger over central Atlantic than over the former two regions, especially during MAM and JJA. In both seasons, the extinction profile of dust is much closer to that of all‐aerosol in the upper level than the lower level, suggesting the larger impact of transported Saharan desert dust in the upper level. During other seasons, dust impact is much smaller. The maximum altitude of extinction greater than 0.001 km −1 is highest in JJA, ~6 km for both dust and all‐aerosol. The seasonal vertical profile of each aerosol type occurrence frequency is shown in Figure . Over NW Pacific, clean marine is the dominant type from the surface up to 3 km in nearly all seasons. Polluted dust dominates from ~1 to 4 km, and both dust and polluted dust are dominant types at 4–10 km in MAM. Smoke plays an important role above 3 km in JJA and SON, although polluted dust has a comparable frequency below 8 km. The relatively high occurrence frequency of smoke in the middle to upper troposphere could be due to transport of fire generated aerosols in Eurasia during April–September across the NW Pacific [e.g., Dwyer et al ., ; Damoah et al ., ]. During DJF, dust becomes important again, dominating from 5 to 9 km. Over North Atlantic, dust is the dominant type at 2.5–4.5 km during JJA and SON, while smoke dominates above 4.5 km. In MAM, dust and polluted dust are the dominant types and have comparable occurrence frequencies detected above 3 km; while in DJF, smoke becomes the dominant type above 3 km. Over central Atlantic, dust is the dominant type only in MAM and JJA at 2–6 km, consistent with its large impact on the all‐aerosol extinction. Smoke always dominates above 6 km in all seasons, and its dominance can extend downward to 3 km in SON. Polluted dust is the dominant type detected at 2–5 km in DJF but is classified less often in other seasons. Regarding the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude, the three oceanic regions have similar patterns (Figure ). The altitude of the dust frequency peak is lower than that of all‐aerosol throughout the year. However, exceptions appear in DJF over NW Pacific and in MAM/JJA over central Atlantic. The altitudes of the frequency peak for dust and all‐aerosol are nearly the same in these exceptional cases, presumably due to the dominant role of dust in the aerosol loading, as shown in Figure . Over NW Pacific, the altitudes of the frequency peak for dust and all‐aerosol are highest in MAM, above 5 km. This is consistent with the extinction profile shown in Figure . During other seasons, the dust layer appears to be limited within the boundary layer and the lower troposphere. In general, over oceanic regime areas, the dominant aerosol types include clean marine, dust, polluted dust, and smoke; clean marine is the dominant type near the ocean surface, while the other three types have large geographical and seasonal variations, as discussed in the context above. The dust contribution to the all‐aerosol extinction is small or only limited to the upper level. The dust layer top has a lower altitude of peak occurrence frequency than that of all‐aerosol. Two exceptions are NW Pacific in MAM and central Atlantic in MAM/JJA. The former is related to the strong trans‐Pacific transport of dust in the middle to upper troposphere from Asia, and the latter is associated with the dust output from the nearby Sahara desert. Diurnal Variation of the Vertical Distribution of Aerosol Properties The CALIPSO measurements are divided into daytime and nighttime periods, providing an opportunity for us to evaluate aerosol diurnal variability. However, it is important to recognize that two phenomena are observed by CALIPSO Level 3 data, namely, natural diurnal variability and artificial diurnal variability due to differences in layer detection and type classification at daytime relative to nighttime. The CALIPSO signal is noisier during daytime, causing some optically thin layers to go undetected that would have otherwise been detected at nighttime. Aerosol typing is also affected because depolarization, a ratio of two noisy numbers, is used to discriminate between aerosol types. Increased noise may generate a different aerosol type classification during daytime than if the layer was classified at nighttime. Since there is a statistical difference in daytime versus nighttime layer detection sensitivity, Level 3 averaging tends to elucidate artificial diurnal variability. In the discussion that follows, observations that are possibly related to natural diurnal variability are noted, although artificial diurnal variability could also play a role. More work is needed in the future to determine the relative importance of these two diurnal variabilities. We have analyzed the differences of aerosol extinction, occurrence frequency of aerosol type, and layer top altitude between daytime and nighttime, and the results show little seasonal variation. Thus, in the following discussion, we only choose JJA season to illustrate the diurnal variation of detected aerosol properties. The differences are calculated as nighttime minus daytime measurements. Biomass burning regime (Figure ). The positive values of the all‐aerosol extinction difference suggest larger extinction during nighttime. However, the altitude of the difference peak is dependent on the region. In South America, the difference peaks near the surface and decreases with altitude. In southern Africa, the difference peaks at ~3 km. In SE Asia, the difference peaks at ~1.5 km and changes sign below 1 km. Dust extinction shows a much smaller diurnal difference compared with all‐aerosol. Generally, smoke and polluted continental aerosols are detected more frequently during nighttime in the lower troposphere, while polluted dust is detected less frequently below 1 km. In South America, polluted dust has a higher occurrence frequency detected at 1–3 km during nighttime. In southern Africa and SE Asia, clean marine aerosol is detected more frequently from the surface to ~4 km during nighttime. Regarding the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude, during nighttime, the aerosol layer top is observed at high altitudes more frequently than during daytime. Both dust and all‐aerosol show this diurnal variation, although dust variability is much smaller than that of all‐aerosol. One exception is in southern Africa, where the dust layer top also shows a higher occurrence frequency in the boundary layer and dust variability is comparable to that of all‐aerosol. The higher occurrence frequency of the aerosol layer top at high altitudes during nighttime may be due to two reasons: first and also the main reason, sunlight adds noise to the lidar signal, reducing the layer detection sensitivity at daytime; CALIPSO lidar has a better SNR and higher feature detection sensitivity at nighttime than daytime [ Liu et al ., ], so CALIPSO could detect more aerosols at high altitudes. Second, CALIPSO flies in a Sun‐synchronous orbit, with 01:30 and 13:30 local time for crossing the equator; thus, the measurements are in the early afternoon and after midnight. Numerous observations have shown that over land, the diurnal maxima of deep convection and precipitation occur frequently in the late afternoon or early evening [e.g., Dai et al ., ; Soden , ; Dai , ; Nesbitt and Zipser , ]. The deep convective activity may transport aerosols to higher altitudes, which could also lead to a higher occurrence frequency of aerosols at high altitudes detected by CALIPSO during nighttime than daytime. Desert regime (Figure ). One distinct feature is that the diurnal extinction difference profiles of dust and all aerosol are overlapped except in west Australia. This is due to the dominant role of dust in the aerosol composition. Aerosol extinction is slightly larger near the surface during nighttime than daytime. In west Australia, dust extinction shows little diurnal variation above the boundary layer. Aerosols are classified as dust and polluted dust more often at nearly all levels during nighttime, while other aerosol types are observed to have little diurnal variation, in northern Africa and west China. The diurnal difference of dust is detected about 2–3 times larger than that of polluted dust. In west Australia, polluted dust, polluted continental, and clean marine aerosols are detected more frequently from ~0.5 to 2.5 km during nighttime, while dust and other types are observed to have little diurnal variation. Similar to biomass burning areas, the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude is detected larger at high altitudes during nighttime. It is worthwhile to point out the positive diurnal differences of all‐aerosol around 18 km in northern Africa and west China are detected only during JJA but are not detected in other seasons (not shown). This suggests that the aerosol layer which only occurs in JJA may be optically thin because it is not detected during daytime. Fossil fuel and industry regime (Figure ). All‐aerosol extinction is larger during nighttime at almost all levels in India and west Europe, detected at 2–6 km in East U.S. and at 1–6 km in east China. However, all‐aerosol extinction is smaller during nighttime detected below 2 km in India during other seasons (not shown). Dust extinction has a much smaller diurnal variation than all‐aerosol extinction, except in India and East U.S. during MAM (not shown) and JJA. The difference profile of dust extinction is closely overlapped with that of all‐aerosol extinction in India, owing to the dominance of dust during MAM and JJA; during the same period, the difference of dust extinction is closely overlapped with that of all‐aerosol extinction below 2 km in East U.S. As for the difference of the aerosol type occurrence frequency, smoke and polluted dust are detected more frequently during nighttime at almost all levels except in east China. However, other aerosol types have a large geographical difference. In India, dust is detected more frequently below 2 km and above 4 km and less frequently at 2–4 km during nighttime. In east China, both dust and polluted dust are detected less frequently, while polluted continental and clean marine aerosols are detected more frequently, below 2.5 km. Dust is detected more frequently at all levels during nighttime in west Europe, while it has little diurnal variation in East U.S. Similarly, the occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude is larger at high altitudes during nighttime, with a larger diurnal difference of all‐aerosol than dust. However, dust layers are also detected slightly more frequently within the boundary layer during nighttime. Similar to northern Africa and west China, positive diurnal differences of all‐aerosol around 18 km in India and east China are only detected during JJA but are not detected in other seasons (not shown). Oceanic regime (Figure ). Dust extinction is larger below 2 km at nighttime than daytime, with the maximum diurnal difference detected at the surface. This may be partly due to the effect of land‐sea breeze, which is a well‐known meteorological phenomenon [ Miller et al ., ] caused by the temperature differences between the sea and the land near the coast. The extinction of all‐aerosol is larger during nighttime at all levels over NW Pacific and above 1 km over North Atlantic and central Atlantic. Polluted continental and clean marine aerosols are detected more frequently below 4 km, while polluted dust is detected less frequently below 1 km over all the oceanic regions. Over NW Pacific and central Atlantic, both polluted dust and smoke are detected more frequently above 1 km during nighttime. Over North Atlantic, smoke does not show much diurnal variation. The occurrence frequency of the maximum aerosol layer top altitude is larger at high altitudes during nighttime, with a larger diurnal difference of all‐aerosol than dust. One exception is over central Atlantic, where the dust layer is also detected more frequently above the surface (2–3 km) during nighttime. Positive diurnal differences of all‐aerosol around 18 km are only obvious over NW Pacific during JJA. Summary and Conclusions We have performed a statistical analysis of seasonal vertical distributions of aerosol properties, including extinction coefficient, aerosol type, and maximum aerosol layer top altitude, based on CALIPSO lidar measurements at 532 nm during nighttime from March 2007 to February 2012. The diurnal variations (differences between nighttime and daytime measurements) of aerosol properties are also discussed. We selected 13 domains and categorized them into four groups according to their surface aerosol emission regimes. The regional and seasonal variations of the vertical distribution of aerosol properties are summarized in the following. Biomass burning regime : Smoke is the dominant aerosol type detected from the lower to the middle troposphere. Dust contributes little to all‐aerosol extinction from the surface to the lower troposphere. The dust layer top has a lower altitude of the peak occurrence frequency than that of all‐aerosol. In South America, the altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust layer top is 3 km throughout the year, while that of all‐aerosol can reach 7 km during wet seasons. In southern Africa, the all‐aerosol extinction profile shows two peaks, at ~500 and 3 km in JJA and SON. During MAM and JJA, dust has larger impact on all‐aerosol extinction above 4 km than lower levels. The aerosol type occurrence frequency has large seasonal variations in this region. The altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust layer top is nearly the same as that of all‐aerosol in MAM and JJA. In SE Asia, aerosol properties do not show much seasonal variation. Throughout the year, clean marine aerosol is the dominant type detected below 4 km. The altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the aerosol layer top is ~7 km for all‐aerosol and ~1–2 km for dust. Desert regime : Dust is the dominant type detected from the surface to the middle troposphere and sometimes can extend to above 8 km. Dust contributes significantly to all‐aerosol extinction at nearly all levels. The dust layer top has nearly the same altitude of the peak occurrence frequency as all aerosol. West Australia is an exception. The detected aerosol characteristics in this region are closer to the biomass burning regime rather than the desert regime. A notable common feature in northern Africa and west China is a secondary peak of the layer top occurrence frequency of all‐aerosol, which is detected at ~18 km only during JJA, suggesting the existence of an aerosol layer at the tropopause level during boreal summer. In northern Africa, the largest extinction near the surface is detected in JJA. Dust is the dominant type with a constant occurrence frequency more than 50% detected at ~1–4 km during all seasons except DJF. In west China, the overlap of dust and all‐aerosol extinction profiles only occurs in MAM. A secondary peak of dust extinction is detected around 2.5 km during MAM and JJA. During MAM, dust can reach as high as 11 km, and the altitude of the peak occurrence frequency of the dust layer top is the same as that of all‐aerosol. Fossil fuel and industry regime : The dominant aerosol types detected include polluted dust, smoke, and dust, with each type dominating at different levels. The dominant aerosol types also have large geographical and seasonal variations. Dust contribution to all‐aerosol extinction is highly dependent on the location and season. If big desert areas are included in the domain or nearby, dust can play an important role during some specific periods. During other periods, dust has little impact on the all‐aerosol extinction, and the dust layer top has a lower altitude of the peak occurrence frequency than that of all‐aerosol. A notable feature is detected over India and east China, i.e., a distinct secondary peak occurrence frequency of the all‐aerosol layer top at ~18 km only during JJA. In India, the extinction profile of dust is close to that of all‐aerosol in MAM and JJA, and dust reaches a higher altitude than in other seasons. Dust is the most often detected type from near the surface to as high as 10 km in MAM. In east China, the dust extinction profile is close to the all‐aerosol extinction profile only in MAM. Dust is detected as the dominant type above 2 and 3 km in MAM and DJF, respectively, and can reach as high as 11 km during MAM. In west Europe, dust is detected to contribute more to all‐aerosol extinction in the upper level than the lower level during MAM and JJA. Dust (polluted dust) is detected predominantly above (below) 3 km in nearly all seasons. Aerosols are classified as smoke less often than dust and polluted dust in this region. In East U.S., dust contributes little to all‐aerosol extinction. Polluted dust is detected predominantly in the lower to middle troposphere and can reach as high as 10 km in MAM and JJA. Smoke is detected predominantly above 5 km during JJA and SON. Oceanic regime : The dominant aerosol types detected include clean marine, dust, polluted dust, and smoke; clean marine dominates near the ocean surface, while the other three types have large geographical and seasonal variations. Dust contribution to all‐aerosol extinction is small or only limited to the upper level. The dust layer top has a lower altitude of the peak occurrence frequency than that of all‐aerosol. Two exceptions are NW Pacific in MAM and central Atlantic in MAM/JJA. The former is related to the strong trans‐Pacific transport of dust in the middle to upper troposphere from Asia, and the latter is associated with dust output from the nearby Sahara desert. Over NW Pacific, polluted dust is detected as the dominant type from ~1 to 4 km, and dust dominates at 4–9 km in MAM. Smoke plays an important role above 3 km in JJA and SON. During DJF, dust becomes the dominant type detected from 5 to 9 km. Over North Atlantic, dust is the dominant type detected at 2.5–4.5 km during JJA and SON, while smoke dominates above 4.5 km. In MAM, dust and polluted dust are the dominant types detected above 3 km, while in DJF, smoke becomes the dominant type detected above 3 km. Over central Atlantic, the extinction profile of dust is much closer to that of all‐aerosol in the upper level than the lower level during MAM and JJA. Dust is detected as the dominant type only in MAM and JJA at 2–6 km. Smoke is detected most often above 6 km in all seasons, and its dominance can extend downward to 3 km in SON. In general, the nighttime minus daytime differences of aerosol properties do not show much seasonal variation except for a few cases. Within the same aerosol regime, the diurnal variation is similar. The main points of diurnal variations of aerosol properties are summarized in the following. All‐aerosol extinction is larger during nighttime, while dust extinction shows little diurnal variation except when dust dominates in the aerosol composition. Smoke is detected more frequently from the lower to middle troposphere during nighttime. Clean marine and polluted continental aerosols are detected more frequently, while polluted dust is detected less frequently, in the lower troposphere during nighttime. The aerosol layer top is detected at high altitudes more frequently during nighttime. The dust layer top shows a much smaller diurnal variation than the all‐aerosol layer top and could be detected slightly more frequently near the surface during nighttime than daytime. Although the Version 1.0 Level 3 aerosol profile product is a beta release [ CALIPSO , ], our analyses of this data set suggest that the seasonal and diurnal variations of aerosol vertical distributions look qualitatively reasonable in most regions in terms of extinction coefficient, aerosol type, and maximum aerosol layer top altitude. More dedicated efforts of improving CALIPSO retrieval algorithms are needed to produce aerosol extinction profiles with much improved quality in the future.

In addition, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone partly affect changes in tropospheric circulation. Tropospheric jets in the Southern Hemisphere are influenced by changes in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic [e.g., Son et al. , , ; Eyring et al. , ]. Latitudinally dependent heating attributable to tropospheric ozone and black carbon may have caused expansion of the tropics in the Northern Hemisphere during the last three decades [ Allen et al. , ]. Therefore, examination of future changes in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone distribution is important to evaluate the effect of ozone on climate change. Meteorological variability plays a crucial role in interannual variation in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone distribution [e.g., Hess and Mahowald , ; Eyring et al. , ; Pozzoli et al. , ]. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a dominant mode of interannual variation in ozone in the troposphere. The earliest study of it analyzed tropical tropospheric ozone changes during the 1997 El Niño (the positive phase of ENSO) using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer instruments [ Chandra et al. , ]. Analysis of long‐term ozonesonde and satellite data revealed ozone changes related to ENSO in the troposphere [ Ziemke and Chandra , ; Ziemke et al. , ; Randel and Thompson , ]. Recent studies using satellite instruments (Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard Aura) observed vertically resolved ozone changes associated with ENSO [ Oman et al. , ]. Many modeling studies have demonstrated that the observed tropospheric ozone change associated with ENSO was reproduced in simulations forced by the assimilated meteorology [ Sudo and Takahashi , ; Chandra et al. , , ; Nassar et al. , ], and in simulations forced by the observed sea surface temperature variability [ Doherty et al. , ; Oman et al. , , ]. Sudo and Takahashi [ ], Chandra et al. [ ], Doherty et al. [ ], and Nassar et al. [ ] have also suggested that meteorological condition changes play a crucial role in the large‐scale variation in tropospheric ozone and that anomalous wildfires cause increased tropospheric ozone over Indonesia. Sudo and Takahashi [ ] reported that the key meteorological factors are upward versus downward motion, enhanced versus suppressed convection, and their associated water vapor changes. Furthermore, satellite and ozonesonde observations showed a negative anomaly of ozone above the tropical tropopause, and positive anomalies in the lower stratosphere over approximately 30°–50°N and S during the positive phase of ENSO over the past few decades [e.g., Randel et al. , ; Randel and Thompson , ]. Randel et al. [ ] demonstrated that a chemistry‐climate model reproduced those anomalies of the stratospheric ozone. These ozone changes are related to an acceleration of the Brewer‐Dobson circulation during the positive phase of ENSO [ Calvo et al. , ]. Tropospheric ozone has increased from the pre‐Industrial era to the present because of increased emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors (NO x , CO, nonmethane VOCs) and methane [ Fusco and Logan , ; Lang et al. , ; Stevenson et al. , ]. Stratospheric ozone has been depleted over the past three decades, which is attributable to increased emissions of ozone‐depleting substances (ODSs) [ Gillett et al. , ]. In the future, both emissions and climate change are expected to influence changes in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone [ Brasseur et al. , ; Zeng et al. , ; Eyring et al. , ; Kawase et al. , ]. Future changes in stratospheric ozone are expected to be influenced by a decrease in temperature and by a strengthening of the Brewer‐Dobson circulation associated with climate change [ Li et al. , ]. In the troposphere, the strengthening also increases tropospheric ozone through stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone [e.g., Collins et al. , ; Sudo et al. , ; Zeng and Pyle , ]. In the lower troposphere, higher water vapor facilitates the chemical destruction of tropospheric ozone [ Johnson et al. , ]. Moreover, higher temperature decomposes PAN into NO x more efficiently [e.g., Doherty et al. , ]. Recent studies have also investigated the future changes under the framework of multimodel intercomparison projects [ Stevenson et al. , ; Eyring et al. , , ; Young et al. , ]. This study quantifies the individual impacts of transport and chemical processes on the ozone changes on two time scales. We specifically examine (1) variation related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a dominant mode of interannual variation of tropospheric ozone, and (2) long‐term change between the 2000s and 2100s. Sekiya and Sudo [ ] assessed the individual impact on the ENSO‐related variation in tropospheric ozone. The present study further investigates the individual impacts on the ENSO‐related variation in vertical ozone distribution from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. Regarding the long‐term change in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, previous studies investigated a response of ozone to an individual external forcing (e.g., tropospheric ozone precursors, ODSs, and GHGs). We must also investigate the role of the individual process quantitatively. Additionally, we test sensitivities of the ENSO‐related variation and the future changes in ozone to increased horizontal resolution of the representation of atmospheric circulation and advection apart from chemistry using the model with two horizontal resolutions (about 300 km and 120 km). Therefore, this study does not consider an impact of horizontal resolution change on the nonlinearity of the ozone chemistry in the stratosphere and troposphere. Earlier studies have typically used chemistry‐climate models (CCMs) with about 300 km horizontal resolution. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether such CCM resolution simulates the variation and change appropriately. This paper is organized as follows. provides the model description, experimental settings, and observational data. We compare the present‐day simulation with observations in . In , we evaluate ENSO‐related variation of ozone during 2004–2009 by comparison with satellite and ozonesonde observations. shows future projections of ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Finally, in , we summarize the results and present our conclusions. Methodology Model Description This study used two version of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM [ Watanabe et al. , ]: (1) an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) version which includes full‐chemistry processes, (2) an O 3 ‐tracer‐transport (tagged‐tracer) model version [ Sudo and Akimoto , ]. The AGCM version was used to archive the production rate ( P ) and loss frequency ( β ) of O x family. The family is defined as a sum of O 3 , O( 1 D), and O. The O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version was driven by the archived P and β from the AGCM version. This version was applied to quantify individual contributions of transport and chemical processes to ozone changes and to test a sensitivity of ozone changes to increased horizontal resolution of ozone transport. The AGCM version is an atmospheric component of the original version of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM which includes atmosphere, ocean, and land surface models (i.e., an earth system model). The model used for this study consists only of AGCM coupled with a Spectral Radiation‐Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) aerosol model [ Takemura et al. , ] and a CHemical AGCM for Studies of atmospheric Environment and Radiative forcing (CHASER) atmospheric chemistry model [ Sudo et al. , ; Sudo and Akimoto , ]. The sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) in the model are prescribed as boundary conditions. We adopt a horizontal resolutions of T42 (about 2.8°×2.8°) with 57 vertical layers from the surface to about 52 km altitude. The vertical resolution increases to 1000 m per level from the surface to 5 km, decreases again to 680 m per level from 5 km to 8 km, remains constant (680 m per level) for 8–35 km, and increases to 3500 m per level above 35 km. Tracer transport in the model is simulated using the piecewise parabolic method [ Colella and Woodward , ] and the flux‐form semi‐Lagrangian scheme [ Lin and Rood , ] on a grid scale. The model also incorporates tracer transport on a subgrid scale (convective transport and vertical turbulence mixing). The model uses fourth‐order (▽ 4 ) horizontal hyperviscosity diffusion. The e ‐folding time of the smallest resolved wave is 1.3 days for the T42 simulation. Although the model incorporates the McFarlane [ ] orographic gravity wave parameterization, no nonorographic gravity wave parameterization is included. CHASER simulates details of photochemistry in the troposphere and the stratosphere, chemical tracer transport, wet and dry deposition, and emissions. In this study, the model incorporates 93 species and 263 reactions (58 photolytic, 184 kinetic, and 21 heterogeneous reactions), including the chemical cycle of O x ‐NO x ‐HO x ‐CH 4 ‐CO with volatile organic carbons (VOCs) oxidation and halogen (Cl and Br) chemistry. All chemical reactions are calculated in the troposphere and the stratosphere. In the scheme of chemical reactions, the P and β of O x family are simultaneously archived. The P is defined as the total production rate of O x by the following reactions: NO 2 + h ν → NO + O, O 2 + h ν → 2O, and the other 9 reactions. Moreover, the β is the total loss frequency of O x by the following reactions: O 3 + O → 2O 2 , O( 1 D) + H 2 O → 2OH, the reactions of O x with HO x , NO x , Cl, and Br radicals, and the other 29 reactions. In the troposphere, wet deposition (rain out and wash out) is calculated in the framework of cumulus convection and large‐scale condensation schemes in the AGCM. The model also calculates dry deposition [ Wesely , ] at the surface. Lightning NO x production is calculated in the framework of cumulus convection scheme in the AGCM. This scheme calculates the global lightning NO x production of about 5.2 Tg N/year for the 2000s. In the stratosphere, the model simulates formation of the polar stratospheric cloud, its gravitational settling, and heterogeneous reactions on it. The model uses the scheme adopted at the Center of Climate System Research/National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES) stratospheric chemistry‐climate model [ Nagashima et al. , ; Akiyoshi et al. , ]. Additional information of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM can be found in Watanabe et al. [ ]. The O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version was used to quantify individual contributions of transport and chemical processes to ozone changes and to test a sensitivity of ozone changes to increased horizontal resolution of transport representation. Atmospheric dynamical and physical processes in the model are identical to those in the original version of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM. The ozone tendency at each grid is written as _placeholder_formula_ where C stands for the ozone concentration in the O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version and where subscripts denote processes. The model calculates the ozone tendency attributable to transport and dry deposition processes (first and second term) in the same way as the original version, although the P and β are prescribed by the output obtained from the AGCM version of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM which includes full chemistry in CHASER. The P and β at each time step are linearly interpolated from the three hourly mean outputs of P and β . A simulated value in the O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version does not exactly match that in the AGCM version (including full chemistry). However, those versions with the same initial condition show similar results ( ). Using the model with T42 (2.8°×2.8°) and T106 (1.1°×1.1°) horizontal resolutions, we test the sensitivity of changes in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone to changes in horizontal resolution. For the T106 model, the e ‐folding time of the smallest resolved wave is 0.9 days. The P and β for the T106 model are linearly interpolated from the P and β for the T42 model. To test the impact of the interpolation method, we compare the T106 simulations in which two types of P and β are prescribed. One is linearly interpolated. The other is calculated using the area‐weighted interpolation. The results of comparison suggest that the difference of ozone attributable to the interpolation method is less than that attributable to the meteorological field (see the ). Because the P and β for the T106 model is calculated from those for the T42 model, this study does not consider an impact of horizontal resolution on the nonlinearity of the ozone chemistry in the stratosphere and the troposphere. Experiments We performed time‐slice runs for the 2000s and the 2100s, which mean an average state in the years around 2000 and 2100, respectively. We compare the time‐slice run for the 2000s with satellite and ozonesonde observations. The time‐slice runs are also used to investigate future change in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone between the 2000s and 2100s. A transient run for 2004–2009 was also performed. We evaluate ENSO‐related variation in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone during 2004–2009 in the transient run. To obtain boundary conditions (chemical production and loss rate of O x family, N 2 O, CH 4 , and CFCs) for the O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version, we conducted simulations using the AGCM version with T42 resolution (hereinafter FC). Subsequently, we performed simulations using the O 3 ‐tracer‐transport model version with T42 and T106 resolutions (hereinafter MTT and HTT, respectively). In this study, we, respectively, refer to T42 and T106 as medium and high horizontal resolution. The simulation settings used for this study are presented in Tables and . Time‐Slice Simulation We conducted time‐slice FC simulations for the 2000s and the 2100s. Their lengths are 5 years in each period. The simulation lengths in this study are the same as Zeng et al. [ ] and within the range of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) time‐slice simulations (4–14 years) [ Lamarque et al. , ]. Initial conditions were taken from the result of ACCMIP experiment for the corresponding period using MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM because CH 4 and N 2 O concentrations in the experiments are in equilibrium state under the condition in each period. We specified the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ODSs in 2000 [ Meinshausen et al. , ], and the emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors in 2000 [ Lamarque et al. , ] as the boundary conditions for the 2000s (Table ). The average of HadISST data [ Rayner et al. , ] for 1995–2004 was used as the SST/SIC for the 2000s. The biogenic emissions of isoprene and terpenes estimated by Guenther et al. [ ] were reduced, respectively, by 20 % to 400 Tg C/year and 100 Tg C/year following Houweling et al. [ ] and Roelofs and Lelieveld [ ]. We used the monthly mean climatology of biogenic emissions because this study examines a combined impact of anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions and climate change on stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. We chose the RCP6 scenario [ Masui et al. , ] as the concentrations of GHGs and ODSs and the emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors in 2100. The monthly mean anomalies of SST between the 2000s and 2100s in the original version of MIROC‐ESM‐CHEM [ Watanabe et al. , ] added to the SST for the 2000s were used as the SST for the 2100s. The SIC for the 2100s was prescribed in the same manner. We conducted time‐slice MTT simulations for the 2000s and the 2100s. The simulations were conducted for 7 years in each period. The P , β , and GHGs (N 2 O, CH 4 , and CFCs) were prescribed by the output obtained from the time‐slice FC simulations (Table ). The other settings were the same as the time‐slice FC simulations. Additionally, we performed a simulation that calculates the ozone tendency attributable to transport and dry deposition with the 2100s boundary condition and the ozone tendency attributable to chemistry with the 2000s boundary condition (hereinafter MTT‐fCHEM). To assess the sensitivity of the future change in ozone to the change in horizontal resolution, we performed time‐slice HTT simulations for the 2000s and the 2100s. Their lengths were 7 years in each period. The boundary and initial conditions for the time‐slice HTT simulations were linearly interpolated from those for the MTT simulations. Transient Simulation We conducted transient FC, MTT, and HTT simulations during 2004–2009 with the SST/SIC in the corresponding year (Tables and ). The other settings were the same as those of the time‐slice simulations for the 2000s. This study also performed transient MTT‐fCHEM simulation, which maintained the P and β at the average for 2004–2009 and which allowed the ozone tendency because of transport and dry deposition to vary among years. However, the P and β for the MTT‐fCHEM simulation accompanied diurnal and seasonal cycles which were averaged during 2004–2009. Observation Data We used data derived from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instruments for evaluation of the stratospheric and tropospheric ozone in the model. The MLS/TES data were constructed following Oman et al. [ ]. MLS level 2 version 3.3 data were used for ozone above 261 hPa. The data were screened using the quality and convergence threshold recommended by Livesey et al. [ ]. We used TES level 3 version 2 monthly mean data for ozone below 261 hPa. TES ozone profiles have about 2 degrees of freedom for signals in the troposphere [e.g., Worden et al. , ]. The MLS and TES data were mapped into the model grid. Oman et al. [ ] used the MLS data from August 2004 to May 2012 and the TES data from September 2004 to December 2009 because the frequency of TES observations decreased after January 2010. However, we used data from September 2004 to December 2009, when both MLS and TES are available. In this study, the averaging kernels of MLS and TES were not applied to the simulated ozone. We also used ozonesonde data for comparison with the simulations for the 2000s ( ). We applied the ozonesonde data compiled by Tilmes et al. [ ], which are climatological data of 42 selected stations for 1995–2011. We also acquired monthly mean data obtained at Samoa, Java, and Hilo for 2004–2009 obtained from Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes (SHADOZ) [ Thompson et al. , , , ]. Those data were used for evaluation of the simulated variation in ozone associated with ENSO ( ). Evaluation of Present‐Day Ozone We first compare ozone in the simulation for the 2000s with that in the observational data before investigating the ENSO‐related variation and the future change in ozone. The simulated ozone volume mixing ratio is compared with the MLS/TES data and the ozonesonde observations. Figure a shows the annual and zonal mean ozone in the MLS/TES observation averaged for the period during 2005–2009. General features of the observed distribution are reproduced by the FC, MTT, and HTT simulations (contour in Figures b– d). Figures b– d also show differences between the observed and the simulated ozone in the stratosphere and troposphere. The difference is within 10 % in the middle and upper stratosphere (1–20 hPa). However, the simulated ozone in the lower stratosphere is high biased to that in the MLS/TES observation (10–30 % in 20–50 hPa and 30–60 % in 50–200 hPa). In contrast, the simulated ozone in the middle troposphere is low biased (15–40 % ). In the upper stratosphere, the FC simulation shows a negative bias which is not seen in the MTT and HTT simulations. This difference reflects the difference of the model version. The FC simulation (the AGCM version) calculates O 3 , while the MTT and HTT simulations (the O 3 ‐tracer transport model version) calculate O x tracer. Figures a– d show biases of ozone in the simulations and the MLS/TES observation relative to that in the ozonesonde observation. Each panel of Figure shows the average of all available profiles at the stations, which are located in the corresponding latitude band. The ozone profiles in the simulations and the MLS/TES observation are sampled at the closest grid to the station. Although the bias of ozone observed by the MLS/TES instruments is within 10 % compared to that observed by the ozonesonde in the stratosphere, it is high biased by 50 % in the troposphere. The simulated ozone in the MTT is high biased to that in the ozonesonde by 30 % above 50 hPa. The simulated ozone shows a positive bias larger than 50 % at altitudes between the tropopause and 50 hPa. The bias near the tropopause is attributable to the simulated tropopause height, which is lower than the observed one, because such large bias near the tropopause in the MTT simulation is not found on the height coordinate relative to the tropopause. The tropopause is determined from temperature lapse rate using the WMO definition [ WMO , ]. In contrast, the tropospheric ozone in the simulations is low‐biased to that in the ozonesonde by 30 % . The FC simulation shows biases similar to the MTT simulation in the all latitude bands at altitudes between 1000 hPa and 10 hPa. The simulated tropospheric ozone in the HTT simulation is similar to that in the MTT simulation in the extratropics. In the tropics, tropospheric ozone in the HTT simulation is larger compared to that in the MTT simulation (Figures b and c). The increase reduces the bias in the southern tropics, although it raises the bias in the northern tropics. The results of the MTT simulation are generally similar to those of the FC simulation (Figures b and ). Therefore, we present only the results of the MTT and HTT simulations hereinafter. ENSO‐Related Variation This study evaluates ENSO‐related ozone variation in the simulations forced by the observed SST variability with that derived from the MLS/TES instruments and the SHADOZ ozonesonde network. The observed variation related to ENSO was found by Randel and Thompson [ ] and Oman et al. [ , ]. Additionally, we test the sensitivity of the ozone variation to increased horizontal resolution using the simulations with medium (about 300 km) and high (about 120 km) resolutions. The interannual variation of ozone in the lower stratosphere is influenced by the quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO) as well as ENSO [e.g., Randel and Wu , ; Oman et al. , ]. Therefore, we used multiple linear regression analysis to assess the ENSO‐related variation in ozone in the MLS/TES observation and the HTT simulation as _placeholder_formula_ Therein, C is an anomaly of ozone, a represents the partial regression coefficient, X denotes indices of ENSO and QBO, and ϵ stands for a residual term. The Niño3.4 index was used as the index of ENSO. The Niño3.4 index was calculated from the HadISST data. Two orthogonal time series based on empirical orthogonal function analysis of zonal wind at equator were used as the QBO indices [ Wallace et al. , ; Randel and Wu , ]. The QBO indices for the MLS/TES observation and the HTT simulation were calculated, respectively, from the zonal wind field in the ERA‐Interim data and the HTT simulation. Linear regression analysis was applied for the MTT simulation because the MTT simulation does not internally generate QBO. This analytical method resembles that used in Oman et al. [ , ]. We analyze the simulation during 2004–2009 to evaluate the simulated ozone variation related to the observed SST variability during the same period as that of the observation. However, the simulation length is shorter than that in the previous studies [e.g., Doherty et al. , ; Oman et al. , , ]. We present the 3 month running mean of the Niño3.4 index, the anomaly of ozone in the MTT and HTT simulations (Figure ). In the MTT and HTT simulations, the simulated anomaly of ozone is well correlated with the Niño3.4 index at 3 km and 12 km altitude in the tropical eastern Pacific. The correlation coefficients are −0.79 (−0.84) in the MTT simulation, and −0.76 (−0.83) in the HTT simulation at 3 (12) km altitude. The ozone anomaly in the regions follows the Niño3.4 index during the positive phase of ENSO. The difference between the anomaly and the index stands out during the negative phase of ENSO. The month‐to‐month variation also contributes to the difference. Figure a presents the partial regression coefficient of ozone observed by the MLS/TES instruments with respect to the Niño3.4 index averaged in the tropics (15°S–15°N). The MLS/TES observation shows a positive anomaly over Indonesia and the Indian Ocean. Local peaks of the anomaly are located at 80°E and at 14 km altitude (up to 5 ppbv/K), and at 100°E at altitudes between 5 and 10 km (up to 3 ppbv/K). A negative anomaly of about 2 ppbv/K is found in the middle troposphere over the central and eastern Pacific. The anomaly reaches 10 ppbv/K near the tropopause. The regression coefficient of ozone in the MTT simulation shows a similar spatial pattern to that in the MLS/TES observation (Figure b). However, the MTT simulation underestimates the magnitude of the observed anomalies. The HTT simulation generally shows a spatial pattern of the anomalies similar to that in the MTT simulation, although the HTT simulation partly improves the underestimation in the central and eastern Pacific. However, the anomaly over Indonesia and the Indian Ocean is underestimated in the MTT and HTT simulations (about 1 ppbv/K) because the monthly mean emission from biomass burning in 2000 was used in the simulations during 2004–2009. In the tropical lower stratosphere, the observed and the modeled variation in ozone show a negative anomaly of approximately 20 ppbv/K. The spatial pattern of the variation in tropospheric ozone in our model is similar to that in HadAM3‐STOCHEM [ Doherty et al. , ] and Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry‐Climate Model (GEOSCCM) [ Oman et al. , ], despite their different simulation periods. The simulation periods are 6 years (2004–2009) in this study, 23 years (1980–2002) in Doherty et al. [ ], and 25 years (1985–2009) in [ Oman et al. ]. The difference of the anomalies between the MTT and the HTT simulations is mainly attributable to the increased horizontal resolution of the representation of atmospheric circulation and advection because the simulations prescribed the same chemical production and loss rate of O x . One reason for the difference is the different response of the Walker circulation to the observed SST variation. We calculate the sensitivity of the simulated Walker circulation to the observed SST variation using the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) as a proxy of the Walker circulation and compare it with the sensitivity of the SOI obtained from NOAA CPC ( ). We defined the sensitivity as a linear regression coefficient of the SOI with respect to the Niño3.4 index. The sensitivities are −0.53±0.29K −1 in the MTT simulation, −0.72±0.23K −1 in the HTT simulation, and −0.88±0.22K −1 in the observation. The range of the sensitivities is a two‐sided 95 % confidence interval. These sensitivities indicate that the Walker circulation in the HTT simulation is more sensitive to the observed SST variation than that in the MTT simulation. The sensitivity in the MTT simulation is out of the range of the observed sensitivity, although that in the HTT simulation is within the range of the observed sensitivity. In the eastern Pacific, positive anomalies in the MLS/TES observation and the simulations are apparent at 12–20 km altitudes over the subtropics and the midlatitudes (Figure ). The positive anomalies in the MTT simulation (about 10 ppbv/K) are weaker than those in the MLS/TES observation (about 50 ppbv/K), especially in the Northern Hemisphere, although the anomalies in the HTT simulation are comparable to those in the MLS/TES observation. The simulated positive anomalies extend to the low to middle troposphere over the subtropics (0.5–1 ppbv/K). The simulated anomalies are in agreement with the observed anomalies. These anomalies are slightly weaker than those in GEOSCCM (2–3 ppbv/K in the low to middle troposphere and 10–15 ppbv/K near the tropopause shown in Oman et al. [ , Figure ]). The anomalies can result from enhanced transport of Asian pollution and increased stratosphere‐troposphere exchange of ozone during El Niño [ Langford et al. , ; Hsu et al. , ; Zeng and Pyle , ; Koumoutsaris et al. , ; Voulgarakis et al. , ], reflecting the intensified subtropical jet, and the enhanced local Hadley circulation, and the accelerated Brewer‐Dobson circulation [ Shapiro et al. , ; Wang , ; Calvo et al. , ]. The enhanced meridional circulation is also shown in Figure with arrows. A negative anomaly is also found in the tropics in the MLS/TES observation and the simulations. As with Oman et al. [ ], the modeled negative anomaly is narrower in latitude than the observed anomaly in the tropical troposphere. The HTT simulation improves the tropical negative anomaly in the middle troposphere compared to that in the MTT simulation. We also investigate the zonal mean response of temperature and ozone to ENSO. Figure shows the temperature regression and partial regression coefficients with respect to the Niño3.4 index. In the tropical troposphere, the ERA‐Interim data, the MTT simulation, and the HTT simulation show a positive anomaly, although the simulations overestimate the anomaly in the ERA‐Interim. In contrast, a negative anomaly of 0.4 K/K is found in the tropical lower stratosphere in the ERA‐Interim. The simulations also show the negative anomaly of 0.2 K/K in the MTT simulation and 0.6 K/K in the HTT simulation. Over 30°–60°N and S, positive anomalies are found in the lower stratosphere. The model underestimates the positive anomaly of 0.6 K/K in the ERA‐Interim in the Northern Hemisphere. The difference between the ERA‐Interim and the simulations is attributable to the weak anomalous descent in the lower stratosphere of the northern midlatitude. The spatial pattern of the anomalies of temperature in this study is similar to that in SAGE observation, ozonesonde observation, and the simulation with WACCM [ Randel et al. , ; Randel and Thompson , ]. Regarding zonal mean ozone, the MLS/TES observation and the simulations show a negative anomaly in the tropical lower stratosphere, and positive anomalies in the midlatitude lower stratosphere (Figure ). In the tropical lower stratosphere, the negative anomaly in the MTT and HTT simulations is comparable to the observed one (20–30 ppbv/K). However, the simulated positive anomaly above 18 km altitude over 30°–60°N (about 5 ppbv/K in the MTT simulation and 10 ppbv/K in the HTT simulation) underestimates the observed one (about 50 ppbv/K). At 12–18 km altitude over 30°–60°S, the HTT simulation reproduces the positive anomaly of approximately 5 ppbv/K derived from MLS and TES, although the MTT simulation underestimates it slightly. Randel et al. [ ] and Randel and Thompson [ ] also analyzed SAGE and ozonesonde observations and the simulation with WACCM. Results of this study show the regression coefficient of −2.5–3 % per standardized Niño3.4 index in the tropical lower stratosphere and the regression coefficients of 0.6–1.2 % per standardized Niño3.4 index in the midlatitude lower stratosphere. However, the regressions in the MTT and HTT simulations are weaker than those in Randel et al. [ ] and Randel and Thompson [ ]. Additionally, we compare the ENSO‐related variation in the MLS/TES observation and the simulations with that in the ozonesonde observation during 2004–2009 in the tropical Pacific. This evaluation is similar to that in Oman et al. [ ], which used the observation in the two western region SHADOZ locations (Java and Kuala Lumpur) and the three eastern region SHADOZ locations (Samoa, Hilo, and San Cristobal) for 1998–2009. At Java, the simulations, the MLS/TES observation, and the ozonesonde observation show ozone increases in the troposphere (Figure a). However, the simulations slightly underestimate the increase observed by the ozonesonde observation. At Samoa, the observed and the simulated ozone are decreased, although the simulated ozone underestimates the observed one in the middle troposphere (Figure b). At Hilo, the simulations and the ozonesonde observation show a positive anomaly in the middle troposphere and a negative anomaly in the upper troposphere (Figure c). The HTT simulation partly improves the underestimation of the negative anomaly in the upper troposphere. In the tropical lower stratosphere, a negative anomaly of about 40 ppbv/K is observed at all stations. The simulations tend to underestimate the observed negative anomaly (10–34 ppbv/K). The vertical profiles of the regression coefficient with respect to the Niño3.4 index in this study are similar to that in Oman et al. [ ]. Table shows ENSO‐related variation in the vertical mass flux at 100 hPa. During the positive phase of ENSO (El Niño), increases in upward and downward mass fluxes are seen, respectively, in the tropics and the extratropics. The change in the simulated fluxes is, however, underestimated compared to the fluxes in the ERA‐Interim. The MTT simulation presents the flux change stronger than that in the HTT simulation in the northern extratropics, although the difference is within the range of the two‐sided 95 % confidence interval. In the southern extratropics, the MTT simulation shows the flux change weaker than that in the HTT simulation, and the difference exceeds the range. In the tropics, the HTT simulation exhibits the change in the flux slightly larger than that in the MTT simulation. We estimate the vertical ozone flux at 100 hPa from a wind field of the ERA‐Interim and an ozone field of the MLS/TES data. The flux indicates increases in upward and downward ozone fluxes, respectively, in the tropics and the extratropics (Table ). The change in the ozone fluxes in the simulations is weaker than the change estimated from the ERA‐Interim and the MLS/TES data in all latitude bands. We also quantify the individual impacts of transport and chemical processes on the ozone variation. The MTT simulation accommodates year‐to‐year variation of both the transport field (wind field) and chemical field ( P and β of O x ), although the MTT‐fCHEM simulation allows only the transport field to vary among years. The impact of transport is defined as a regression coefficient of ozone in the MTT‐fCHEM simulation with respect to the Niño3.4 index. We also define the impact of chemistry as a regression coefficient of ozone difference between the MTT simulation and the MTT‐fCHEM simulation with respect to the Niño3.4 index. The simulations present that transport and chemistry have comparable impacts on the ozone variation in the tropics (Figures a and b). However, the impact of chemistry is dominant in the lower troposphere over the central and eastern Pacific. Our simulations show that the impact of chemistry is greater than that shown in Sekiya and Sudo [ , Figure ] over the Indian Ocean. This difference reflects an increase in the production rate of O x over Africa in the FC simulation, in which a regression coefficient of lightning NO x production with respect to the Niño3.4 index is positive (7.3 kg N/m 2 /s/K) over Africa. In the subtropics over the eastern Pacific, transport and chemistry play significant roles in most regions. Nevertheless, the impacts of transport are dominant in the midlatitude lower stratosphere over the eastern Pacific (Figures c and d). The model also calculates separate tracers for O 3 produced in the stratosphere ( p > 100 hPa) and the troposphere ( p < 100 hPa). These indicate that ozone from the stratosphere and the troposphere, respectively, contribute to the ozone increase because of transport in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. In the lower troposphere, ozone from the troposphere dominates the ozone increase. These results also suggest that the ozone increase in the subtropics is caused not only by the intensified stratosphere‐troposphere ozone exchange but also by the variation in tropospheric transport. For example, the export of Asian pollution to the Pacific is enhanced during El Niño, resulting from intensification and a southward shift of the northern subtropical jet over the eastern Pacific [ Koumoutsaris et al. , ]. Future Changes We performed future projections of climate and ozone and investigated the future changes. The sensitivity of the change to the horizontal resolution is also assessed by comparing the projection with two horizontal resolutions (about 300 km and 120 km). We used the results obtained for the last 5 years for each period. Figure portrays the change in annual and zonal mean temperature between the 2000s and 2100s. The MTT simulation shows warming of 4 K in the troposphere and cooling of 4 K in the stratosphere (Figure a). The HTT simulation exhibits warming similar to that in the MTT simulation in the troposphere. Moreover, the HTT simulation predicts slightly stronger cooling in the tropical lower stratosphere, weaker cooling in the high latitudes in the lower stratosphere, and stronger warming in the subtropical lower stratosphere (Figure b). The model predicts an increase in the global stratospheric ozone burden by 0.24±0.01 % /decade in the MTT simulation and by 0.29±0.01 % /decade in the HTT simulation. We regard an uncertainty range of the change as a root‐sum‐square value of the standard deviation in the simulations for the 2000s and the 2100s. The predicted changes in annual and zonal mean ozone between the 2000s and 2100s show a decrease by 20 ppbv/decade in the tropical lower stratosphere, as well as an increase by 20 ppbv/decade in the extratropical lower stratosphere (Figure ). An uncertainty range of the change is smaller than the change (30 % of the change) in most of the region where the change is confident at the 98 % level (shaded region). The difference of the changes in stratospheric ozone in the MTT and HTT simulations is within the range of the changes, except in the lower stratosphere over the northern high latitudes, where the difference reaches 18 ppbv/decade (about 2 times larger increase) at 23 km altitude. The global annual mean ozone change at 50 hPa is −2.8 ppbv/decade in the MTT simulation and −1.4 ppbv/decade in the HTT simulation, which are smaller and opposite changes compared to the multimodel mean of CMIP5 and CCMVal‐2 models [ Eyring et al. , ]. Particularly, we must interpret the change in the lower stratosphere over the northern middle to high latitudes with some caution because our model simulates a decrease in ozone at 50 hPa over there, in contradiction to the result of CMIP5 models. The global tropospheric ozone burden is reduced between the 2000s and 2100s by 0.82±0.04 % /decade in the MTT simulation and by 0.76±0.04 % /decade in the HTT simulation. A reduction of the tropospheric ozone concentration is typically 0.8 ppbv/decade in the free troposphere over the northern midlatitudes (Figure ). The simulated tropospheric ozone is increased slightly in the upper troposphere over the southern subtropics (typically ≤ 0.2 ppbv/decade). An uncertainty range of the change is smaller than the change (30 % of the change) in most of the region where the change is confident at the 98 % level (shaded region). The difference of the tropospheric ozone change between the MTT and HTT simulations is less than 0.1 ppbv/decade in the middle and lower troposphere and is comparable to the range of the change in tropospheric ozone. In comparison with the time‐slice simulations for the 2000s and the 2100s along with RCP6 scenario in Young et al. [ ], the reduction of the global tropospheric ozone burden in this study is similar to that simulated by the ACCMIP models (0.9 % /decade). The change in tropospheric ozone in this study also shows a similar value to that in the ACCMIP models (0.5–1 ppbv/decade) in the free troposphere over the northern midlatitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, our simulations show no increase in tropospheric ozone, as shown in the mean of the ACCMIP models. However, our model predicts the reduction of the global tropospheric ozone burden larger than that (−0.15 % /decade) in Kawase et al. [ ]. The differences of temperature and ozone between the MTT and HTT simulations are at least partially attributable to a difference in the strengthening of the Brewer‐Dobson circulation (BDC). The HTT simulation shows an acceleration of BDC stronger than that in the MTT simulation (arrows in Figure ). At 100 hPa, the vertical mass flux is strengthened by 20 % in the MTT simulation and by 25 % in the HTT simulation in the 2100s compared to the 2000s (Table ). The acceleration of BDC results in an increase of ozone influx from the stratosphere to the troposphere. We also examine the vertical ozone flux at 100 hPa instead of STE ozone flux (Table ). The upward ozone flux is not altered significantly in the tropics because the ozone decrease and the enhanced upwelling cancel each other out at 100 hPa. The downward ozone fluxes in the extratropics of Northern and Southern Hemispheres are increased in the MTT simulation (1.93 and 5.19 Tg/yr/decade, respectively). The HTT simulation predicts that the downward fluxes in the northern and southern extratropics are, respectively, 5.22 and 9.11 Tg/yr/decade, which are about 2 times larger than those in the MTT simulation. The future ozone change results from changes in ozone transport (e.g., changes due to atmospheric circulation, convection, and vertical diffusion) and changes in chemical ozone production and loss (e.g., changes due to temperature, water vapor, emissions of ozone precursors and ODSs). This study regards bringing air mass to a region with lower or higher water vapor as an impact of transport processes. To ascertain the processes determining the future change in ozone, we investigate the individual impacts of transport and chemistry on the future ozone change. The MTT simulation for the 2000s and the 2100s calculates ozone with the transport field (wind field) and the chemical field ( P and β of O x ) for the corresponding period. The MTT‐fCHEM simulation calculates ozone with the transport field for the 2100s and the chemical field for the 2000s. We define the impact of transport as the difference between the MTT‐fCHEM simulation and the MTT simulation for the 2000s. Moreover, we define the impact of chemistry as the difference between the MTT simulation for the 2100s and the MTT‐fCHEM simulation. Figures a and b, respectively, depict the ozone change between the 2000s and 2100s attributable to transport and chemistry. The change in ozone is driven mainly by chemistry in the stratosphere. The decrease in ODSs dominates the ozone increase attributable to chemistry in the extratropical lower stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropical lower stratosphere and the extratropical lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, the decrease in ozone attributable to chemistry is caused by a decrease in the production of ozone, which exceeds a decrease in the loss of ozone. The decrease in production is related to a decrease in the actinic flux through an overhead ozone increase. The decrease in actinic flux also leads to a decrease in OH through the reaction of H 2 O + O( 1 D), although an effect of increased water vapor compensates an effect of decreased O( 1 D) in the FC simulation. In the troposphere, chemistry processes cause a reduction of the global tropospheric ozone burden by 1.07 % /decade, reflecting the emission reductions of tropospheric ozone precursors and climate change (Figure b). Transport processes increase the global burden of tropospheric ozone by 0.25 % /decade, corresponding to 23 % of the decrease in the global tropospheric ozone burden attributable to chemistry (Figure a). The model also calculates separate tracers for O 3 produced in the stratosphere ( p >100 hPa) and the troposphere ( p < 100 hPa). Figures c and d suggest that the increase in the global tropospheric ozone burden attributable to transport is contributed by ozone of both the tropospheric origin (57 % ) and the stratospheric origin (43 % ). Summary and Conclusion This study investigates ozone changes and the individual impacts of transport and chemistry on those changes. We specifically examined (1) the variation related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a dominant mode of the interannual variation of the tropospheric ozone, and (2) the long‐term change between the 2000s and 2100s. Additionally, we conducted simulations at two horizontal resolutions (about 300 km and 120 km) to test a sensitivity of ozone changes to the increased horizontal resolution of the representation of atmospheric circulation and advection. However, we do not consider any aspect of the nonlinearity of ozone chemistry sensitivity to horizontal resolution. Our model captures general features of the observed ozone climatology, although the simulated ozone is high biased in the lower stratosphere and is low biased in the troposphere. These biases in the simulation of two resolutions are similar. To evaluate our CCM, this study examined the ENSO‐related variation in tropospheric and lower stratospheric ozone in the simulations of medium resolution and high resolution forced by the observed SST variability. The medium‐resolution and high‐resolution simulations show an increase in tropospheric ozone (1 ppbv/K) over Indonesia, and a decrease (2–10 ppbv/K) in the tropical eastern Pacific. The results generally agree with the variation observed by the MLS/TES instruments. In the midlatitude lower stratosphere over the eastern Pacific, increases by 10 ppbv/K and by 50 ppbv/K are also found, respectively, in the medium‐resolution and high‐resolution simulations. The simulated increase in the high‐resolution simulation agrees with the observed one better. In the other regions, no great difference is found between the two simulations. To investigate the processes determining the ENSO‐related variation of ozone, we quantified the individual impacts of transport and chemistry using a sensitivity simulation fixed to the average chemical field for 2004–2009. The simulation shows that transport and chemistry play important roles in the ozone variation in most regions. However, chemistry strongly affects the ozone decrease in the tropical lower troposphere over the eastern Pacific. Transport processes dominate the ozone increases in the midlatitude lower stratosphere over the eastern Pacific. Transport of ozone of both the stratospheric origin and the tropospheric origin contribute to the upper tropospheric ozone increase, although the ozone increase results from ozone of the tropospheric origin in the lower and middle troposphere. We also investigated the future change in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone between the 2000s and 2100s under the RCP6 scenario in the time‐slice simulations of the two resolutions. The model predicts an increase in the global stratospheric ozone burden by 0.24±0.01 % /decade in the medium‐resolution simulation and by 0.29±0.01 % /decade in the high‐resolution simulation. The predicted changes in annual and zonal mean ozone show a decrease by 20 ppbv/decade in the tropical lower stratosphere, and an increase by 20 ppbv/decade in the extratropical lower stratosphere. However, the medium‐resolution simulation predicts a decrease in ozone in the lower stratosphere over the northern middle to high latitudes (5–10 ppbv/decade). This result is opposite to that of CMIP5 models shown in Eyring et al. [ ]. It is necessary to interpret the ozone change there with particular caution because our model simulates the decrease in ozone there in contradiction to the results obtained from CMIP5 models. The global tropospheric ozone burden is reduced by 0.82±0.04 % /decade in the medium‐resolution simulation and by 0.76±0.04 % /decade in the high‐resolution simulation. A reduction of tropospheric ozone concentration is typically 0.8 ppbv/decade in the free troposphere over the northern midlatitudes. The changes in the global burden of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone in the medium‐resolution and high‐resolution simulations are different, although the differences are comparable to the uncertainty range of the changes. To elucidate the processes determining the future change in ozone, we investigated the individual impacts of transport and chemistry on the ozone change using a sensitivity simulation with the 2100s transport field and the 2000s chemical field. The change in the global stratospheric ozone burden is controlled by chemical processes. Chemical processes also reduce the global burden of tropospheric ozone by 1.07 % /decade. However, transport processes increase the burden by 0.25 % /decade. The increase attributable to transport is contributed to by ozone of both the stratospheric origin and the tropospheric origin. This fact suggests not only that the increased influx of stratospheric ozone causes the increase in the global tropospheric ozone burden as shown in the previous studies [e.g., Collins et al. , ; Sudo et al. , ; Zeng and Pyle , ] but also that the future change in tropospheric circulation raises the global tropospheric ozone burden. Our results are obtained from one model. To confirm the robustness of our result, it is necessary to compare the results of other models such as the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative models [ Eyring et al. , ]. We also examined the respective impacts of transport and chemical processes on the future change in stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. However, the result must be interpreted with caution because they are estimated from the simulations conducted only with the medium horizontal resolution. In addition, a detailed investigation of the future ozone change attributable to chemical processes is not performed. Additional simulations and analyses must be done to assess the impacts of tropospheric ozone precursor emissions, ODS emissions, and climate change.

As argued by in his comment on the study of , we emphasize the dominant role played by the barotropic response of sea level associated with increased ocean mass upon adding ice‐melt. Accordingly, the global mean sea level should adjust within a matter of days, through barotropic waves traveling at speeds of order 200 m s −1 , to changes in the ocean mass induced by melting land‐ice. A complementary emphasis was provided by , who focused on the slower and smaller steric adjustment of sea level arising from meltwater induced changes in salinity. As noted by , differences between the barotropic response and the far slower (roughly 100 times slower) baroclinic/advective response to land‐ice melt are particularly relevant for coastal and low‐lying regions. Worldwide, all such regions should experience, within the matter of days, sea level rise associated with land‐ice melt from either the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets (or glaciers elsewhere). pointed out that conclusions “that it will take a significant length of time until the Pacific Ocean will “feel” this extra volume, for example, in form of sea level rise” is misleading and dependent on the use of virtual salt fluxes to represent mass gain by the ocean. clarified that this statement is concerned only with the (local) steric sea level change and that his study did not consider the mass‐induced change. Virtual salt fluxes represent the additional freshwater input by changing the model's salt content but neglects the far greater freshwater mass gain. Here, we investigate the impact of directly representing the mass gain by the ocean results for a rapid global response of sea level. To date there remains a considerable uncertainty about melting rates, the sea level response, and its spatial distribution. It is therefore our aim here to demonstrate the fast global ocean adjustment in response to high‐latitude freshwater forcing. The study is based on numerical simulations analogous to , where we use an ocean model in which the simulated sea level responds directly to the input of meltwater associated with idealized land‐ice melt scenarios. estimated an additional global freshwater flux to the ocean due to melting ice sheets of 50–100 GT yr −1 since 1992, with enhanced contribution of 200 GT yr −1 since 2005. These rates correspond to 0.14–0.28 mm yr −1 and 0.56 mm yr −1 of global mean sea level rise, respectively [ ]. Estimates by are 20% higher, where the global mean sea level rise signal is 0.5 mm yr −1 from Greenland and 0.21 mm yr −1 from the combination of East and West Antarctica. To date, the maximum high‐latitude ice sheet melting rate was estimated by to be in 2006, and corresponds to a global mean sea level rise of 1.3 ± 0.4 mm yr −1 . estimate a contribution of 1.0 mm yr −1 global mean sea level rise due to the total ice and water mass loss from the continents over the period 2003–2009. The contributions from Greenland and Antarctica are in addition to contributions from melting land‐ice in other parts of the world. Over recent decades these ice sheet contributions exceed the global mean sea level increase due to thermal expansion of the upper 700 m of the water column of 0.52 mm yr −1 [ ]. The importance of mass gain for sea level rise is consistent with the fact that for a given amount of heat, a much greater sea level rise results from melting land‐ice rather than expanding the ocean. ( estimate a factor of 60–70 [see also ]). Thus on the longer term, climate change may well result in substantially larger mass contribution than thermal expansion contribution to sea level rise. We focus in this paper exclusively on the impacts of changing ocean mass on sea level rise, so do not consider quantitatively the steric expansion effects associated with adding freshwater to the ocean. The remainder of this note consists of the following Sections. In , we detail the model configuration, and highlight key differences from the model used by . The sea level response to meltwater perturbation experiments is described in , and we offer discussion and concluding remarks in . The Model and Experimental Design The perturbation experiments follow the recommendation of the Coordinated Ocean‐ice Reference Experiment (CORE) version III proposed by . Specifically, we add a freshwater perturbation of magnitude 0.1 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 10 6 m 3 s −1 ) to the ocean in a region surrounding Greenland, with this amount of water equivalent to 3150 GT yr −1 of ice melt (equivalent to 8.7 mm yr −1 global mean sea level rise). An analogous configuration is chosen for the Antarctic melt event, with 0.1 Sv of meltwater spread evenly around the Antarctic continent. illustrates the additional melt applied in the Greenland and Antarctic perturbation experiments. Both melt patterns are reflective of those used by . However, the total glacial freshwater flux used in the simulations by was close to 800 GT yr −1 (compare also ), which is equivalent to roughly a 2 mm yr −1 global sea level increase and is about 1/4 of what is used here. Later, we will show that the results scale linearly with the magnitude of the mass contribution. We use the CORE‐I “normal year forcing” product of for our control and perturbation simulations. The control simulation follows the set‐up detailed in . The perturbation simulations are identical, except for the addition of idealized glacial meltwater. Differences between the meltwater perturbation simulations and the control provide the sea level response associated with enhanced melting. Following , the sea level as defined here incorporates the mass loading from sea ice, as we are only concerned with the net sea level associated with the mass of both liquid and solid water in the ocean. We focus on sea level differences between the control experiment, consisting of the unmodified CORE runoff, and the modified Greenland (termed here GLISM, Green Land Ice sheet Melting) and Antarctic (termed here AAISM, Antarctic Ice sheet Melting) runoff experiments. The model used in this study is the Australian Climate Ocean Model (AusCOM) which is the ocean‐ice component of the global coupled atmosphere‐ocean general circulation model within the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS). AusCOM incorporates the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Modular Ocean Model (MOM4p1) [see ] and the Los Alamos National Laboratory CICE4.0 sea ice model [ ]. The French CERFACS PRISM 2–5 OASIS3 coupler (OASIS3.25) [ ] mediates the interaction between the ocean and sea ice. The ocean model includes a representation of barotropic gravity waves, with such waves responding directly to the use of a water flux surface boundary condition as detailed by . These two model features are important for this study. AusCOM's ocean and ice models are configured horizontally with an orthogonal curvilinear grid. North of 65°N the model discretization employs the tripolar grid of . Elsewhere, the model has a 1° resolution in longitude, and is nominally of 1° resolution in latitude with the following two refinements: first, an equatorial refinement to _placeholder_formula_ between 10°S and 10°N; and secondly, a Mercator (cosine dependent) meridional grid spacing for the Southern Hemisphere, ranging from 0.25° at 78°S to 1° at 30°S. AusCOM has 50 vertical levels with 20 levels in the top 200 m. A volume‐conserving (Boussinesq) as well as a mass‐conserving (non‐Boussinesq) version of AusCOM are used to detail how mass perturbations affect the global sea level. Further details of AusCOM can be found in . Global mean sea level _placeholder_formula_ evolves according to _placeholder_formula_ where Q m is the sea surface mass flux (in kg m −2 s −1 ), 〈 ρ 〉 the global mean in situ density, _placeholder_formula_ the global ocean volume and _placeholder_formula_ the global ocean surface area. Global mean sea level changes from mass addition in a Boussinesq formulation do not include the second term on the right hand side of , which is the global steric contribution associated with changes in the global mean density. In our non‐Boussinesq formulation the contribution of the global steric term to sea level changes amounts to 2% at most of the total global mean sea level rise in the first month (not shown). Given that both the Boussinesq and non‐Boussinesq model formulations show nearly identical patterns and magnitudes of sea level change for the perturbation simulations considered in this note, we present results only from the non‐Boussinesq version. For the purposes of this note, an important formulation difference between the ocean model used by and AusCOM is the representation of freshwater fluxes at the ocean surface. formulates the freshwater flux across the ocean surface as a virtual salt flux, Q S , which is calculated according to _placeholder_formula_ where Q m = P − E + R + I is the net freshwater flux (in kg m −2 s −1 ), comprised of precipitation P , evaporation E , river runoff R and ice sheet melt I ( Q m > 0 if the liquid ocean gains freshwater). S ref is a reference salinity set to 35 psu. In addition a relaxation of the model surface salinity toward climatological surface salinity fields was used in . In contrast, AusCOM introduces freshwater directly to the ocean by treating the surface freshwater flux ( Q m ) as a change in ocean mass while maintaining a constant ocean salt content. The mass change in turn modifies ocean volume, with this change radiated globally, within days, through barotropic gravity waves (manifesting in sea level and vertically integrated velocity) that travel at roughly 200 m s −1 in the deep ocean. Both the water flux boundary condition and the associated barotropic response are explicitly represented in AusCOM. To avoid drift in sea level apart from the response to freshwater from idealized glacial melt, I , we follow an approach previously used in forced ocean models that use real freshwater fluxes [e.g., see , Appendix B.3]. Each time step we apply a global correction to any imbalance in global net freshwater mass input to the ocean by P − E + R + SI , where SI is the ocean‐ice freshwater mass flux arising from sea‐ice melting or freezing. This is not strictly conservative for sea level in our freshwater flux formulation, since any drift in total global sea‐ice volume will manifest as a very small equivalent change in global mean sea level. Also, as was the case for , we restore the model surface salinity toward climatological surface salinity fields. The surface salinity restoring can lead to an under‐representation of the halosteric contribution to regional sea level rise in the North Atlantic under a Greenland melting scenario [ ]. Models forced with the virtual salt flux, Q S , change the salt content of the model ocean while keeping the mass constant. Hence, virtual salt flux models omit the rapid barotropic response found in the water flux models and in the real world. For sea level impact studies such as considered in the present paper, differences between virtual salt flux and water flux models are fundamental. However, as we will conclude below, for long‐term sea level adjustment studies (seasonal and longer timescales), the virtual salt flux models are sufficiently accurate as long as the additional mass flux effect is added separately. Some remaining shortcomings of this approach are pointed out by , , , and . Results We start the meltwater perturbation experiments from a simulation integrated for 50 years using the CORE normal year forcing protocol [ ]. Although this protocol omits climate relevant interannual forcing as well as the global climate change signal, we expect that the time mean sea level pattern should reflect the climatological pattern found in the observations. We thus compare in the mean sea level from year 50 of the AusCOM control simulation to the 1993–2007 time mean sea level from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data; ). The simulated and observed sea level patterns share much in common. For example, the sea level difference between the North Pacific and North Atlantic (averaged between 40–65°N) is 48 cm in the observations and 46 cm in AusCOM. There are, however, significant differences in the sea level minimum for convection sites in the Labrador and Irminger Seas, where the local minima are around 20 cm less than observed. Also, the maximum amplitude at the center of the North Pacific's central subtropical gyre exceeds the observed by 20 cm. We are uncertain whether to attribute such differences to model shortcomings or limitations of the normal year forcing. For our purposes, we consider the time mean sea level in AusCOM to offer a sufficiently realistic starting point for examining the sea level signal associated with meltwater perturbations. shows the sea level response to an additional net meltwater of 0.1 Sv entering the ocean surrounding Greenland. The barotropic signal propagates around the world in just a few days. Initially the signal travels as a boundary Kelvin wave southward in the North Atlantic, crosses the basin (partly at the equator) as basin modes and then travels along the eastern boundary, radiating Rossby waves that communicate the signal into the interior. The signal enters the Pacific Ocean through the Indian Ocean and partly through Bering Strait, adjusting the Pacific in a similar manner as it was when spreading across the Atlantic. To some degree the pattern of a global barotopic sea level adjustment is reflective of the mostly steric adjustment discussed by , as well as and . However, the barotropic response is about 200 times faster. Through this barotropic response the bulk of the global ocean experiences, within a few days, a sea level rise. Nevertheless the global ocean is not adjusted after a few weeks and inter‐basin gradients remain, even for the fast component. considers the early response in sea level to Antarctic melt. Adjustment starts with a sea level rise within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), exciting a boundary Kelvin wave, propagating northward along the east coast of South America toward the equator, where it crosses the Atlantic to the eastern side and subsequently propagates poleward in both hemispheres. Thereafter, the barotropic signal propagates globally in a similar fashion to that described above for the Greenland signal. After one week, the bulk of the global ocean experiences a sea level rise. However, the sea level rise remains most pronounced (and above the global mean value) in the basin where glacial meltwater is added, especially around the source of the freshwater, partly because of the sizable local steric response there. Time series of hourly sea level differences between the first month of the control run and the perturbation experiments are shown in . In general, the barotropic response of sea level rise due to additional freshwater mass gain is seen in all regions of the global ocean. For the first month the linear trend for the global mean sea level is 8.6 mm yr −1 for both the Greenland and Antarctic melting experiments. The area‐averaged response for the various regions considered in are quantified in . In particular, we note the response in the Western Pacific box, which includes many of the low‐lying Pacific Islands. This region corresponds to the region under consideration in Australia's Pacific Climate Change Science Program (PCCSP, ). Discussion and Conclusions Examination of idealized Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet melting events using the Australian Climate Ocean Model (AusCOM) show that all regions of the global ocean experience a sea level rise within 7–8 days after the initialization of a meltwater input of 0.1 Sv. To examine the robustness of our results, we conducted accompanying melt experiments in which the Antarctic meltwater was input over a region immediately east of the Antarctic Peninsula, and a separate experiment just over a region immediately west of the Antarctic Peninsula, with the West Antarctic Peninsula simulation more realistic given present concerns about the stability of the ice sheet in this region [ ]. The resulting spatial and temporal adjustments of sea level (not shown) do not differ significantly from the perturbation experiment considered around the whole of Antarctica, indicating sea level anomalies are propagated rapidly around the Antarctic continent as seen in observations and high resolution models [ ; ]. We also examined the degree to which the global mean sea level signal scales according to the magnitude of the freshwater input. For Greenland and Antarctic melting experiments having freshwater inputs of 0.01 Sv and 1.0 Sv, we found that the relative sea level rise scaled proportionately with respect to the 0.1 Sv simulations. We also note that the amplitude of the steric signal of sea level rise (regionally varying and around one‐order of magnitude smaller than the barotropic signal) has a linear response to the amount of applied glacial meltwaters added (not shown). To understand the impact for low‐lying coastal and island regions, it is critical that the mass‐induced sea level signal from meltwater events is included, as well as any regional steric response. This signal leads to the rapid (on the order of days) barotropic rise in global sea level from meltwater perturbations, and is critically important for coastal regions. The far longer‐timescale (decadal) steric signals considered by are generally much smaller than the barotropic signal. This point is highlighted in and , where we show that on the 50 year timescale the model's sea level has risen by approximately 0.45 m in all ocean basins for both the GLISM and AAISM experiments which is substantially larger than the steric signal. After scaling the present results (this study uses a freshwater forcing four times larger than ) and adding the dominant mass induced component to the results, the sum of the steric and mass‐induced changes in both studies are similar. Consequently, while high latitude meltwater events will impact sea level in the far field (including Tropical Pacific Islands) within a matter of days, the results of the present study show it is possible to add the mass‐induced component of sea level rise off‐line when using ocean models that do not explicitly represent the barotropic signal (because they use the virtual salt flux boundary conditions). Note that the sea level rise associated with the increase of mass of the ocean is not uniform (even in the steady state) because the changing mass distribution changes the gravitational field and the Earth's surface loading and the elastic response of the Earth [ ]. These regional distributions need to be combined with the steric signals and glacial isostatic adjustment to get the full regional distribution of relative sea level change [ ; ; ].
